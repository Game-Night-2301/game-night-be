		"description": "<p><em>Scythe</em> gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &quot;Encounter&quot; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br /><br /><em>Scythe</em> uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br /><br />Every part of <em>Scythe</em> has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.</p>",

With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants &amp; Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you!</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Pandemic</strong></em>, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are <em>Epidemic!</em> cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.</p>\r\n<p>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose.

Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pandemic Legacy</strong> is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic <em><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic\">Pandemic</a></em>, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.</p>\r\n<p>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.</p>\r\n<p>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.</p>\r\n<p>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.</p>",

		"description": "<p><em><strong>Brass: Birmingham</strong></em> is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece, <em>Brass</em>. <em>Birmingham</em> tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.</p>\r\n<p>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.</p>\r\n<p>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):</p>\r\n<p>1) <strong>Build</strong> - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br />2) <strong>Network</strong> - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network.<br />3) <strong>Develop</strong> - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br />4) <strong>Sell</strong> - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br />5) <strong>Loan</strong> - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> also features a new sixth action:</p>\r\n<p>6) <strong>Scout</strong> - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original <em>Brass</em>.)</p>\r\n<p>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.</p>\r\n<p>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original <em>Brass</em> as well as in <em>Brass: Birmingham</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New &quot;Sell&quot; system</strong></p>\r\n<p>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features three all-new industry types:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Brewery</strong> - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Manufactured goods</strong> - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pottery</strong> - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Increased Coal and Iron Market size</strong> - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.</p>",

Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phasea€s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase. For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur, otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as his bonus. Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player's hand by selecting Consume. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and card powers that provide advantages in certain phases. The player who best manages his cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins. The winner is the player with the most victory points.</p>",

Find out, in <em>Santorini</em>!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><em><strong>Santorini</strong></em> is a re-imagining of the purely abstract 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been continually developed, enhanced and refined by designer Gordon Hamilton.</p>\r\n<p>Santorini is an accessible strategy game, simple enough for an elementary school classroom while aiming to provide gameplay depth and content for hardcore gamers to explore, The rules are simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Move</strong> - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Build</strong> - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved. When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Winning the game</strong> - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Variable player powers</strong> - Santorini features variable player powers layered over an otherwise abstract game, with 40 thematic god and hero powers that fundamentally change the way the game is played.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br /><br />Turns in <em>Santorini</em> are made up of two simple step: Move and Build. Move around the board and build a building in a spot adjacent to one of your workers. The first player to move their worker from a second level building to a third level building wins the game! Though, there are a few things that add a wrinkle to the basic formula.<br /><br />Invoke the Power of the gods!<br />Each player will have access to a god power which lets them do things a little differently than normal. Be it changing the rules for how you can build or move, changing how you interact with other players, or providing you with an alternate victory condition, the 30 different god powers are sure to make every game of <em>Santorini</em> different and exciting!</p>\r\n</div>",

Can you make it to the end of your journey and turn a tidy profit? Find out in Great Western Trail!<br /><br /><strong>Simple Mechanics, Complex Decisions</strong><br />Turns in Great Western Trail are broken into three simple phases that will carry you through the entire game. These simple phases belie a web of deep and complex decisions players will face as they make their way down the trail. The mechanics are simple, but mastering the trail is where the fun lies.<br /><br /><strong>Make Your Move!</strong><br />A turn starts by moving your cattleman down the trail. The number of spaces a player is allowed to move is dictated by their player board, and there are hazards a plenty all along the trail. Wherever you end up, the next phase is ...<br /><br /><strong>Take Action!</strong><br />When a player ends their movement, they perform the action listed on the space they ended on. Depending on where you land, you will have different options available to you. Neutral locations or buildings you own will allow you to perform a special action specific to that location or a single auxiliary action. On locations owned by other players, hazard tiles, or teepee tiles, your only option is to use an auxiliary action. Last, there's Kansas City!<br /><br /><strong>Kansas City or Bust!</strong><br />Landing on Kansas City sets off a series of subphases that must be resolved in order: Three Foresight phases, the Income Phase, and the Delivery Phase. The Foresight subphases give players a choice between two tiles to add to the board (hazard, teepee, or worker). These tiles will affect future trips down the trail, so choose wisely. Earn income from your journey down the trail by revealing and discarding your hand. Finally, choose a city to deliver your cattle to. This leg of your journey is over. Now it's time to do it all again!<br /><br /><strong>Draw!</strong><br />Draw up to your hand limit and your turn is over! Time to start planning your next move and figure out the choices you'll face in the coming turns.</p>\r\n</div>",

It's the Vikings' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin's side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &quot;Gods' Gifts&quot; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!</p>",

He will win the game!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.</p>\r\n<p>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.</p>\r\n<p>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.</p>\r\n<p>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.</p>\r\n<p>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.</p>\r\n<p>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>0 Links</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

In this new edition, players mark preexisting routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you?re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all. <br /><br />Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants (except for the highly valuable renewable energy wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Power Grid: Recharged Edition</strong> will replace Power Grid. Small but meaningful improvements have been made to the game including updated rules to improve game play, an updated player order tracker, new reference cards, and a discount token to enhance power plant auctions.

At the heart of their society was a mysterious calendar - Tzolk'in. With a length of 260 days, it could predict the right time to plant seeds, the time to build monuments, the day a new baby would be born as well as the movement of the planets. It was the centerpiece of the Mayan cycle of life.<br /><br />We invite you to become one of the ajaw, the leaders of Mayan tribes. Please the gods and lead your clan to prosperity!<br /><br />As in the life of ancient Maya, the center of our game is the Tzolk'in calendar - a set of gears that rotate each round of the game. This unique system helps you to visualize the cyclic flow of time and plan your actions in advance. Harvest crops now, or wait for them to grow a little more for higher yield? All will be clear to see on the wheels of time.</p>",

You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult. No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, each of your adventures in Arkham Horror: The Card Game carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the ancient ones straining against the barriers to our world… the basic mode of play in Arkham Horror: The Card Game is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground.</p>\r\n<p>All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand. And your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.</p>",

As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for.

Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it. Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic.

As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!

		"description": "<p><strong>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</strong> is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven. The game includes four new characters — Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) — that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.</p>\r\n<p>The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?</p>\r\n<p>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry — i.e., learning the game — has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.</p>",

Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.</p>",

When we launched Forbidden Island in 2010, we had an inkling that we had created a hit game but never to the point that we'd be prompted to make a sequel. Well, here we are a few years later with just that in hand. Our challenge to designer Matt Leacock was to create a game that would contain familiar elements (cooperative play, modular board), while offering up a completely different in-game experience. In addition, we wanted it to be simultaneously approachable to new players while upping the ante for those who felt they had mastered Forbidden Island. All this resulted in a fresh new game with an innovative set of mechanics, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and unique method for locating the flying machine parts. Hopefully we've achieved our goals and quenched your thirst for adventure!</p>",

In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.</p>\r\n<p><em>Keyflower</em> presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.</p>\r\n<p><em>Keyflower</em>, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.</p>",

		"description": "<div>\r\n<p>Centuries ago, the spice trade was the most important market in the world. It established and destroyed empires, compelled men to explore the far corners of the earth, and led to the discovery of new worlds. At that time, the value of spices even rivaled that of gold! In the old days, they carried a sense of mystery and allure. Spice merchants would weave fantastic tales of danger to reach these spices in hopes of selling their wares at higher prices. In later centuries, the demand on spices became so great, that those who controlled the spices generated immense wealth and renown. It is at this time, you find yourself leading your caravan across the eastern lands to the Mediterranean Sea in search of wealth and fortune. As a caravan leader, your journey begins on the Spice Road. This is Century: Spice Road!<br /><br />In <strong>Century: Spice Road</strong>, players aim to collect and trade spices in order to acquire point cards and coins that are worth points at the end of the game. Players play cards from their hands to acquire spices for their caravan and trade those spices in for wealth and power (point cards and money), or to purchase new merchant cards to more efficiently acquire rare and valuable spices. Players take one action a turn until someone has acquired their fifth (or sixth in 2-3 player game) point card, players will finish out the current round of play and the person with the most points wins!<br /><br /><strong>Play or Acquire Cards</strong><br />At the start of the game, each player is given two merchant cards to start with and some preliminary spices. On their turn, each player may choose, as their action for the turn, to play a card from their hand, or spend spices to acquire a new merchant card from the row and place it in their hand. Merchant cards allow players to acquire new spices, exchange spices they currently have for different ones, or upgrade a spice to one worth more. Building up a good spice trading engine of merchant cards is an important part of succeeding on the Spice Road, so look out for powerful play sequences when taking new cards!<br /><br /><strong>Rest</strong><br />Once they've played all the cards from their hands, players must use their turn action to rest and return their cards to their hand. Now they'll be able to play their cards again on future turns, building up their caravan and further developing their hand of merchant cards to start acquiring point cards.<br /><br /><strong>Claim Point Cards</strong><br />The way to win in Century: Spice Road is to have the most points at the end of the game. Players get points when they acquire Point Cards and Coins by trading in their spices. Each point card in the row will have a different cost and overall point value listed on it, and the spice cost must be paid to acquire that card. If the two leftmost cards in the row are acquired, whoever acquired one of those point cards can take a coin from the pile above it. Silver coins are worth 1 point at the end of the game and gold coins are worth 3 points! Once a player has bought their fifth point card, the round of play finishes and a winner is crowned!</p>\r\n</div>",

Players control a home planet and a series of space ships within their own personal galaxy. As players upgrade their galaxies they gain access to more ships and more dice.<br /><br />Each turn, a player will roll a set of dice, how many dice are rolled is determined by the level of that player's galaxy. Each side of the die (6 sided) represents a different type of action: Movement, Colony Action, Harvest from Culture Planets, Harvest from Energy Planets, Improve an Economic Influence, Improve a Diplomatic Influence.<br /><br />After the roll, the player then sorts the results of the roll (one selective re-roll is allowed) and organizes the dice in a desired activation order. Each die, in order, is then resolved and the results are immediate! This gets very exciting, as it allows the player to pull-off unseen combos and surprise other players. But don't fret! Other players have the option to copy other player's actions... at a cost!<br /><br />In addition to upgrading galaxies, effective resource management provides luck-mitigating options that can sway the game in a calculated player's favor.<br /><br />As players expand their galaxy by colonizing other planets through economic and diplomatic influence, they gain victory points AND the special powers brought in by those planets!<br /><br />You are the ruler of your galaxy and there are no limits to your expansion!</p>",

Together with his father, Marco hoped to establish news trade routes to bring riches from the East back to Europe, and in <em>The Voyages of Marco Polo</em>, you will attempt to do the same.</p>\r\n<p>Players will attempt to recreate Marco Polo's famous journey over the Silk Road, playing as Marco and his father or one of their many associates from their travels, each with their own unique power.

Find out in <em>The Voyages of Marco Polo</em>!<br /><br /><strong>Preparing to Set Out</strong><br /><em>The Voyages of Marco Polo</em> is a Dice Placement game. At the beginning of each Round, players will roll their dice and then take turns placing those dice in space on the board for various effects. Some spaces have the same effect no matter the number on the die placed there, but some spaces have different effects depending on their result of the roll. Some spaces even require you commit multiple dice and take the action based on the lowest number rolled among the dice placed there.</p>\r\n<p>Placing dice is how players move their merchants down the trade routes and toward Beijing, gather money to pay for goods and their travels, acquire resources to fulfill their contracts. And, spaces are limited! Once another player has filled a space, you'll need to spend more resources in order to take the same action, potentially setting your plan back or forcing you to readjust. Plan well and choose your actions wisely, and you may just find yourself ahead of the pack.<br /><br /><strong>Multiple Strategies</strong><br />There are many decisions to be made from round to round, and there are multiple avenues to victory in any given game. The roads you take to victory can change from game to game thanks to the special power of your character and the unique city bonuses used for each.<br /><br /><strong>Unique Powers<br /></strong> Each character has their own unique ability that can hugely impact your strategy as the game progresses. Raschid ad-Din allows you to choose the value of your dice rather than rolling them. Niccolo and Marco Polo give you an additional figure to move across the map and a camel at the beginning of every round. Take advantage of your special skills and leave your opponents in the dust!<br /><br /><strong>Different City Cards Every Game!<br /></strong> With 31 different city cards, every voyage will be unique. Plan your route carefully as you seek to take advantage of the bonuses each city has to offer. At the beginning of each game, the city bonus cards will be drawn randomly from the deck, providing new strategic opportunities and incredible replayability.</p>\r\n</div>",

From the horse-lords of Rohan to the soldiers of Gondor and the Elven lords of Rivendell, you lead the defense of the last free realms of Middle-earth.<br /><br />Face the evil minions of Sauron on the field of battle in a desperate attempt to delay their onslaught, while you lead the Fellowship of the Ring in the Quest for Mount Doom.<br /><br />As the Shadow player you lead the hordes of the Dark Lord and his most powerful minions as they try to bring darkness to Middle-earth. Legions of Orcs, Trolls, Wolfriders, and the dreadful Ringwraiths await your command. Hunt the Ring-bearer and bring the precious Ring to his Master, or crush your enemies with your unstoppable armies.<br /><br />This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>War of the Ring</strong></em>, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.</p>\r\n<p>The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.</p>\r\n<p>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).</p>\r\n<p>Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Each knows 9 secret agents that the other must contact. Communicating in coded messages, they sneak past enemy assassins in an attempt to complete their mission before time runs out.</p>\r\n<p><em>Codenames: Duet</em> is a cooperative word game for two or more players. A key card gives you 9 words to give clues and 3 words your partner must avoid. A clue is only one word, but it can point to multiple words that you want your partner to guess. Your partner also gives you clues for the words you need to find. If you both find all the words before you run out of turns, you both win!</p>\r\n<p>With a new way to play, 400 new words that work with the original <em>Codenames</em>, and 100 new challenges, <em>Codenames: Duet</em> is sure to push your mind to the limit!<br /><br /><strong>Go Undercover!</strong><br />In <em>Codenames: Duet</em>, players must work together to uncover all the secret agents on both sides of the key card before they run out of turns. You'll need to be quick-witted, because these challenges will put your deductive skills to the test!<br /><br /><strong> It Takes Two to Tango!<br /></strong> You and a partner will pick a key card and set up the grid of words. You'll take turns, going back and forth, giving each other clues to guess as many words as possible before passing to the other player. On their turn, a player gives a word and a number as their clue and the other player makes guesses as to which words hide a hidden operative. Correct guesses are covered in a green agent card, if a player guesses a word that is black on your key card, the game is over and you lose. If a guessed word is tan on the key card, that is an innocent bystander and the turn ends with you taking a token from the time bank and placing it on the guessed word. If the two players can guess all 15 hidden operatives before running out of turn tokens, they win the game!<br /><br /><strong>Sudden Death<br /></strong> If players run out of time, they enter sudden death, relying on previous clues to guess where the remaining operative are hiding. If a word is guessed correctly, the guessing continues, but if a bystander or assassin is uncovered, the game is over and the players lose.<br /><br /><strong>More Ways to Play!<br /></strong><em>Codenames: Duet</em> is designed for two players, but it can be played with a group. Players will split up into two teams and play the game as normal, any member of a team able to give the clue. Teams may privately discuss their clues to come up with the perfect one!</p>\r\n<p>Players may also embark on a campaign using the Mission Map pad. Each completed game will let you move on to new and more challenging missions that change the number of turn counters and bystander tokens. Some missions reduce the number of turns you have while other leave less room for error. After completing these challenging missions, you can consider yourselves Codewords masters!</p>\r\n</div>",

Scarred by the flames of betrayal, Rex is a specter of a fallen empire and of ages long forgotten, yet it remains an object of reverence-and desire-in a galaxy of conflict and uncertainty.<br /><br />Once, the great city that spanned its surface was the pinnacle of civilization. Today, Mecatol City is naught but a blasted shell of its former glory, a grim respite in the toxic Sea of Desolation that covers the majority of the planet.<br /><br />Even so, its parabolic history of decadence and destruction does little to deter those who would seek to harness its power. The Winaaran custodians who dwell within the remnants of the city maintain what is left of the former capital, waiting for one of the Great Races to step forward and take up the mantle of the former Emperors.<br /><br />But who among the races of the galaxy could fill the void left by the Lazax? To lay claim to the throne is a destiny sought by many, yet the shadows of the past serve as a grim warning to those who would follow in their footsteps...</em> <br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition</strong></em> is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.</p>\r\n<p>No two games of <em>Twilight Imperium</em> are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.</p>\r\n<p>A round of <em>Twilight Imperium</em> begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.</p>\r\n<p>After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.</p>",

So, you should probably build some roller coasters and shops to keep your guests entertained. Oh, and maybe invest in some security, because if you don't your dinosaurs may escape and eat your guests, and who wants to deal with regulators coming in and telling you your park is a &quot;death trap&quot;.<br /><br />The game uses 10 full-color dice to create the pool of available DNA at the beginning of the round, and features really unique artwork inspired by early 90s graphic design to catch your eye and 3d renderings for the rides. The game contains Dino-meeples, double thick cardboard with cut outs to keep tracking cubes from sliding when the table is bumped, and two unique mechanisms that we are really fond of.<br /><br />The game-length is variable from 60 minutes to 2.5 hours regardless of player count simply by adjusting the number of &quot;end-game&quot; cards used. The game also features &quot;plot twist&quot; cards that change certain game rules each time you play for endless replay-ability. No two games will ever be the same!<br /><br />The game is a mid-weight strategic worker-placement game with strong thematic integration with the mechanics. We've found the games complexity to be a bit lighter while maintaining tense decisions. This was accomplished by breaking various actions into 4 unique phases so that order of operation is less critical to your success allowing new players to grasp the flow of the game quicker.</p>",

Players will play cards from their hands in a battle to take tricks and score points. </p>\r\n<p><br /><em>The Fox in the Forest</em> has a unique take on scoring that introduces tension into the trick-taking formula. If a player takes too many tricks, they are determined to be greedy and won't get any points at all. Do you want to win this trick and risk winning too many over the course of the round? What is your opponent trying to do?</p>\r\n<p><br />Each of the three suits has a set of special cards that have unique effects when played. The Swan allows you to lead the next trick even if you lose this one. The Fox lets you switch a card in your hand with the decree card setting the trump suit. The Woodcutter lets you swap a card in your hand with one of the extra cards. The Treasure will give the winner of a trick a free point for each 7 in the trick. The Witch will act as the trump suit if it's the only witch in the trick. Finally, the Monarch forces your opponent to play either the 1 of that suit, or their highest ranked card of that suit.</p>\r\n</div>",

Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's too late. Secret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre. The first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor's word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team. The second new mechanic is the &quot;Hitler&quot; identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players' trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.</p>",

Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles. If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose. Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.</p>\r\n<p>The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.

Now is the time for a clever leader to unite them into a powerful alliance, skillfully using the unique talents of each tribe to control the Kingdoms.</p>\r\nDo you have the wit and the wisdom to become the next Lord of <em>Ethnos</em> and usher in a Golden Age? Up to six players can evoke the assistance of the Tribes of <em>Ethnos</em> to earn themselves enough glory to be named the Lord of <em>Ethnos</em>. Find out if you're up to the task!<br /><br /><strong>The Tribes of <em>Ethnos</em></strong><br /><br />There are twelve distinct tribes that inhabit the land of <em>Ethnos</em>, and each has their own unique ability that will help you take control of the Kingdoms and gain glory for yourself. Call on the Centaurs when swift and decisive actions must be taken! Overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers by relying on the Halflings! The Dwarves, Elves, Giants, Merfolk, Minotaurs, Orcs, Skeletons, Trolls, Wingfolk, and Wizards are all at your disposal!<br />Use the special abilities of each tribe to your advantage to take control of territories and gain yourself some extra glory along the way. Work with what you're given to spread your influence and unite the tribes of <em>Ethnos</em> to be crowned the victor!<br /><br /><strong>Beginning a New Age</strong><br />A game of <em>Ethnos</em> is divided into three Ages in which players will try to gain as much glory as possible. On their turn, players will choose to Recruit an Ally (from either the deck or the face up options on the table) or Play a Band of Allies. Recruiting allies to your cause is necessary if you want to gain any influence in the Six Kingdoms, which you do by playing Bands.<br /><br /><strong>Band Together<br /></strong> When you play a Band of Allies from your hand (from 1 to 10 cards), each ally within the band must belong to the same Tribe or the same Kingdom (color). Each band has a leader which will determine the ability you get to resolve when playing the band. If the band is large enough, you may place one of your control markers in that kingdom that matches the color of your leader card. You then use your leader card's ability. Then you must discard the cards remaining in your hand face up for other players to recruit from. These bands will be important for scoring at the end of the round, so leave them in front of you.<br /><br /><strong>Control the Kingdoms<br /></strong> As you gain more influence in a Kingdom, the bigger your bands must be to place your control markers there. Each Kingdom will reward players with an amount of glory at the end of an Age according to who has the most influence in each Kingdom. As Ages pass, the players with the second-most and third-most influence in each Kingdom will also gain glory.<br /><br /><strong> A New Age Dawns<br /></strong> The game will play out over three Ages, and the heralding of a new Age is brought on by the arrival of three dragons. Once the third dragon has been drawn from the deck, the Age ends and scoring for that Age begins. Control markers persist between Ages, representing the influence gained in Ages past. Once this has happened three times, the game is over and final scores can be tallied!</div>",

The Paths of other players cross and connect, so the choices you make affect all the journeys across the board.

Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.</p>",

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Colt Express</strong></em>, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Phase 1: Schemin'</strong> Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Phase 2: Stealin'</strong> The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.</p>\r\n<p>Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items — but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.</p>\r\n<p>Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.</p>\r\n<p>You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><strong><em>Nominated for the 2015 Spiel des Jahres award.</em></strong></p>",

Euro-type game mechanisms offer a smooth gameplay and minimize the downtime. Nevertheless, Eclipse has a lot of details and theme woven seamlessly into the game. For example, you may design your own starships: each player has four ship types that they can build and design as they will. The technology tree also has a new, non-linear system.<br /><br />Eclipse has seven different species for you to choose from. Each player can either play as Terrans (ie. humans) or one of the unique alien species. Each species has different characteristics and abilities.

In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the Forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl. Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions.</p>",

Each round, starting with whoever holds the crown, players will pass around a hand of characters equal to one plus the number of players, secretly choosing one character to employ, taking advantage of their special ability. Among the eight characters you might find, each boasts a different special ability: the Thief can steal all the gold from another player, the King grants gold for each Noble district you have constructed and receives the crown for the next round, and the Architect allows a player to build several districts that turn. <br /><br />After all players have chosen their character, they are revealed in the order determined by their rank, which is the number printed in the upper lefthand corner of their card. For example, if a player chose the Assassin with its rank of 1, they would resolve their turn first. The next to follow is the Thief with its rank of 2, then the Magician at 3, and so on, skipping characters that were not employed this round, and until all players have resolved their actions.<br /><br />When you do resolve your turn, you will choose to either take two gold coins from the bank or draw new district cards. Then, if you can afford to pay its cost, you may construct a single district from you hand. You may also resolve your character abilities as they apply during your turn, whether it be naming a character to kill with the Assassin or gaining extra gold with the Trader. Play continues until all players have resolved their actions, then the character cards are reshuffled and a new round begins.<br /><br />The first player to construct seven districts triggers the endgame, allowing the round to finish and all other players to take their final actions. Each district is worth its cost in victory points, with bonus points awarded for those who construct all seven of their districts and those who have at least one type of each district (noble, religious, trade, military, and unique). Whoever has the most victory points has built the most fabulous city and is crowned winner!</p>",

Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.</p>\r\n<p>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.</p>",

		"description": "<p>Walk a mile in the shoes of a spy! Or was it a kilometer in clogs?<br /><br />SPYFALL is an easy-to-learn card game of bluffing, probing questions, clever answers, and suspicion. At the start of each round, players receive a secret card letting them know where they are - a casino, space station, pirate ship, circus, (30 unique locations!) - except that one player receives the SPY card instead of the location. The Spy doesn't know where he is, but wins the round if he can figure it out before he blows his cover!<br /><br />Players then start asking each other questions during the intense 8-minute rounds. Non-Spy players want to ask questions and give answers that prove to the other players that they know where they are. But watch out! If your questions and answers are too specific, the Spy will easily guess the location and win, so you need to practice a bit of subtlety. But if your questions and answers are too generic, you might be accused of being the Spy. The Spy will also sometimes be asked questions (just like any other player would) and have to come up with questions of his own, without knowing anything about where he is! If you listened carefully to the other players, you'll be able to come up with a plausible question or answer... hopefully.<br /><br />Once per round, each player may accuse another player of being the Spy. If all players agree, the game ends and that player's secret card is flipped up. If the Spy is captured, each of the Non-Spy players win the round. If a Non-Spy is revealed, the Spy wins. Finally, if the Spy figures out where he is, he can reveal his card and make a guess. If he's right, he wins the round. If not, the Non-Spy players win.<br /><br />The game is played over a series of rounds and points are awarded each round. A complete game is typically five rounds and the cards are randomly dealt each round. You could even be the Spy two rounds in a row! After the last round, the player with the most points is the winner.</p>",

However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once.

Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios.

On November 1, 1755, Lisboa suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, followed by a devastating tsunami and 3 days of raging fires. The city was almost totally destroyed.<br /><br />Lisboa is thus played, in part, on a representational map of the city. During the planning of the downtown re-building project, the type of businesses permitted in each street was pre-determined. The clockmakers and goldsmiths had their street; as did the bookstores and libraries; the tailors and silk vendors; and the toolmakers as well. This all comes into play on the Lisboa gameboard. <br /><br />Players represent the nobility of Lisboa who will use their influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. <br /><br />In rebuilding the city, players will make use of the Royal Builder, who works with the architects to build Lisboa anew, while the Marquis will provide aid in the development of commerce. The King will provide players with political help in re-opening the beautiful new city. But the true reason you are rebuilding the city is not for greatness, or even fame or fortune. As a nobleman or noblewoman of Lisboa, your primary motivation is the acquisition of Wigs--a most important trading commodity of the Era, and the means of scoring points in the game.</p>",

One player takes control of the legendary Count Dracula as he stealthily crosses Victorian-era Europe, spreading his diabolical vampirism everywhere he goes. Up to four other players govern Mina Harker and her determined companions as they try to locate and destroy the fiendish Count before he plunges Europe into horrific darkness. But in this heated game of cat and mouse, the hunted prey may also be preying on his hunters. Any day's travel might bring the hunters to Dracula's location. On any night the Count may attack.</p>\r\n<p>This edition features all-new art and graphic design crafted to complement the game's intuitive, thematic mechanics. Rounds are now broken into day and night: hunters take actions during both, but Dracula can only act at night. Combat is now more streamlined and decisive, and new rumor tokens allow Dracula to mislead hunters and extend the terrible reach of his influence. Count Dracula triumphs if he advances his influence track to thirteen; if the hunters can defeat him before then, they save the continent of Europe and win the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fourth edition:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The fourth edition of <em>Fury of Dracula</em> contains pre-painted miniatures instead of unpainted figures.</p>",

High Society pits you against your neighbors in a race to reveal the most blue-blooded family in your midst. To win, you must acquire all the trappings of great wealth, avoid as many pitfalls as you can and still walk away with a huge pile of cash at the end of it all. This Reiner Knizia classic makes a great travel game and an easy one to introduce to friends and family.<br /><br />Originally published in 1995, High Society gained sufficient popularity to see it through 3 re-prints but none of them as beautiful as the latest FRED Edition. Artist Paul Niemeyer has done an outstanding job creating a theme to reflect the most elite fineries of the Gilded Age, combined with FREDs commitment to quality components and card stocks, this edition of High Society will stand as the pinnacle of its production.<br /><br />For 3-5 players over 10 years old, this 30-45 minute game can be played as a light filler between longer games, but to be honest with you, this one is very hard to put back in the box! The cards tells an exciting story and feature beautiful artwork from well-known Eagle Games artist Paul Niemeyer.<br /><br />Game Summary: Players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth, namely the ten luxury possession (positive-number) and three 2X multiplier cards; while avoiding its pitfalls represented by three cards altogether, including the gambling (-5) card; the thief (lose a possession) card; and the calamitous fire (lose one half the value of all your possession cards) card. While bidding, though, players must keep an eye on their remaining cash. At the end of the game, even though all those positive-number cards might add up to a win, the player with the least money is not even considered for victory.</div>",

U.S. President Thomas Jefferson decided to send two explorers - Meriwether Lewis and William Clark - to discover this huge terra incognita. Lewis &amp; Clark is a board game in which the players manage an expedition intended to cross the North American continent. Their goal is to be the first to reach the Pacific. Each one has his own Corps of Discovery that will be completed by the Native Americans and the trappers met during the journey. He has to cleverly manage his characters and also the resources he finds along the way. Beware, sometimes frugality is better than abundance. <br /><br />Lewis &amp; Clark features dual use cards. To be activated, one card must be combined with another one, which becomes unavailable for a while. Thus, players are faced with a constant dilemma: play a card or sacrifice it. During the game, each player acquires character cards that enlarge his hand, building a crew that gives him more options but it needs to be optimized as he will recycle his cards more slowly. This new &quot;hand building&quot; mechanism fits strongly the historical background. Since the aim of the game is to be the first on the Pacific coast, the timing and the opportunistic use of the other players' positions are crucial.</p>",

A Formula 1 pilot has to be willing to take risks and be able to plan ahead - at least if you want to get to the very top of the winners' podium.<br /><br />Formula D also means the suspense of illegal racing on the streets of the big cities. Anything goes: customized cars, nitro fuel injection, skidding in roundabouts, unfair tricks ... The game principles always stay the same, but different cars, rules and circuits come into play.<br /><br />This new edition of Formula D contains material which has not yet been published, including painted cars, dashboards, driver profiles, circuits ...

At the end of the initial setup, shuffle the Ragnarök tokens that are not on the board or on the Age Track and draw two of them. Look at the names of the two provinces listed on the tokens and place one god figure in each of them (these Ragnarök tokens are then put aside).</p>\r\n<p>Each god's ability is always in effect, changing the rules of the province they're in. The rest of the provinces are not affected. After a player attempts to pillage a province containing a god figure, whether he succeeds in the pillaging or not, he must then move the god to a different unpillaged province that does not contain a god figure. So the two gods can never occupy the same province, and they never go to a pillaged or destroyed province.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd Ages, the two gods are again placed in random provinces, determined by drawing 2 unused Ragnarök tokens.</p>\r\n<p>The combination of the two gods used in each game creates a unique texture to that session. They affect draft choices and influence the flow of the battles. Will your try to benefit from a god's power again and again by moving him where you want and always pillaging his province? Or will you do your best to neutralize him by pillaging around his province? Perhaps you'll want to attempt a hopeless pillage on his province just to move him onto another province where he will hinder another player's plans. They add a whole new layer to the game, without adding hardly any complexity to the rules.</p>\r\n<p>The miniatures each come with a tarot-sized God card.</p>",

You finally got some of those rivers you'd wanted, and they led to the sea. These are dangerous, pirate-infested waters, and you cautiously send rat-infested ships across them, to establish lucrative trade at far-off merchant-infested ports. First, you will take over some islands, as a foothold. The natives seem friendly enough, crying their peace cries, and giving you spears and poison darts before you are even close enough to accept them properly. When you finally reach those ports you will conquer them, and from there you will look for more rivers. <br /><br />One day, all the rivers will be yours.<br /><br />This is the second expansion to Dominion. It adds 26 new Kingdom cards. Its central theme is your next turn; there are cards that do something this turn and next, cards that set up your next turn, and other ways to step outside of the bounds of a normal turn.</p>\r\n<p>Dominion: Seaside is an expansion to both Dominion and Dominion: Intrigue. As such, it does not contain material for a complete game. Specifically, it does not include the Treasure, Victory, Curse, or Trash cards. Thus, you will need either the base game or Intrigue to play with this expansion and have experience playing Dominion with either of the first two games. </p>",

One of the players on your team — the Psychic — knows exactly where the bullseye is, and draws a card with a pair of binaries on it (such as: Job - Career, Rough - Smooth, Fantasy - Sci-Fi, Sad Song - Happy Song, etc). The Psychic must then provide a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the &quot;cold&quot; side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region. Perhaps &quot;salad&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>After the Psychic gives their clue, their team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on that spectrum.

		"description": "<p>At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal's greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans — whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Azul: Summer Pavilion</strong></em>, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.</p>\r\n<p><em>Azul: Summer Pavilion</em> lasts six rounds, and in each round players draft tiles, then place them on their individual player board to score points. Each of the six colors of tiles is wild during one of the rounds.</p>\r\n<p>At the start of each round, draw tiles at random from the bag to refill each of the five, seven, or nine factories with four tiles each. Draw tiles as needed to refill the ten supply spaces on the central scoring board. Players then take turns drafting tiles. You can choose to take all of the tiles of a non-wild color on a factory and place them next to your board; if any wild tiles are on this factory, you must take one of them. Place all remaining tiles in the center of the table. Alternatively, you can take all tiles of a non-wild color from the center of play; you must also take one wild tile, if present.</p>\r\n<p>After all tiles have been claimed, players then take turns placing tiles on their individual boards. Each board depicts seven stars that would be composed of six tiles; each space on a star shows a number from 1-6, and six of the stars are for tiles of a single color while the seventh will be composed of one tile of each color. To place a tile on the blue 5, for example, you must discard five blue or wild tiles from next to your player board (with at least one blue being required), placing one blue tile in the blue 5 space and the rest in the discard tower. You score 1 point for this tile and 1 point for each tile within this star connected to the newly placed tile.</p>\r\n<p>If you complete surround a pillar, statue, or window on your game board with tiles, you get an immediate bonus, taking 1-3 tiles from the central supply spaces and placing them next to your board. At the end of the round, you can carry over at most four tiles to the next round; discard any others, losing 1 point for each such tile.</p>\r\n<p>After six rounds, you score a bonus for each of the seven stars that you've filled completely. Additionally, you score a bonus for having covered all seven spaces of value 1, 2, 3 or 4. You lose 1 point for each remaining tile unused, then whoever has the most points wins.</p>\r\n<p><em>—description from the publisher</em></p>",

Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive. Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power.</p>\r\n<p>The aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours. Each turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence among the various areas of society. The game ends once the Kingdom reaches poverty or prosperity - or potentially both!</p>\r\n<p>—description from the publisher</p>",

Two to four players assume the roles of ambitious daimyo competing for control of the nation. To rise above your rivals and influence the nation's cities and villages to your cause, you must prove you can lead their people. Through the strategic placement of tiles, you can establish your sway over lesser lords, the production of rice, and the region's religious leaders. Sometimes, though, even these won't be enough to establish your dominance, and to cement your claim, you must send in your samurai.<br /><br />The FFG edition of Samurai maintains the game's original mechanics while updating it with beautifully sculpted game pieces, new leader tokens to aid in scoring, and all-new art and graphic design that draw upon traditional Japanese styles.</p>",

Players select 5 of their 12 role cards to play per set, then they reveal them in sequence. Each role has a main full action and a less valuable &quot;favor&quot; action. If you are the first player with that role you announce that you are that character. If you follow after but choose that same role card you can take the favor action instead, or declare that you are that character in hopes that you can command the full action. You risk having it taken from you by a later player, though. The different roles help players collect different ingredients and money to make potions listed on the cauldron cards. When everyone's five role cards have been played and actions taken, another five cards are chosen for the next set and the process repeats as before.<br /><br />Broom Service is a revised and expanded version of Witch's Brew. <br /><br />Includes:<br />-Tiles - 32 clouds, 24 magic wands, 15 amulets, and 17 landscape tiles<br />-Wooden pieces - 60 potion bottles, 10 pawns, 5 victory point markers<br />-Cards - 50 (5 x 10) roles cards, 10 events cards<br />-Instructions - 2 game summaries + a 12-page rules booklet<br />-Double-sided game board - For basic and advanced play</p>",

The foundation of the oceanic food chain are billions of one-celled organisms called phytoplankton that capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis. The next level are species that feast on the sea's abundant plant life — zooplankton. All of this takes place in Catherine Hamilton's beautifully illustrated central board called the Reef. Every other oceanic species is a predator, each bigger than the next, all the way up to the dreaded apex predator. And even bigger than apex predators are enormous filter feeders that gently swim through the ocean scooping up everything in their path with their baleen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br />Oceans is a continuation of North Star's quest to make a gamers' game that is easy to teach. Game designers Nick Bentley and Dominic Crapuchettes don't think people need to sit through 30+ minutes of rules explanations to get an immersive experience.</p>\r\n<p>The foundation of Oceans is a simple turn structure and a deck of 10 straightforward traits, making it easy to learn all of the cards and wade effortlessly into the first game. The 10 traits were chosen because of the rich thematic interconnections, providing a tapestry of synergistic card play. Additionally, there are 4 randomly chosen scenario cards that activate (and sometimes deactivate) at various points during the game. The scenario cards impact the basic tenets of gameplay, encouraging people to vary their play style and strategy each game.</p>\r\n<p>This foundation loosely mimics a scientific oceanic ecosystem, similar to what you've come to expect from games in the Evolution series. This is the core of Oceans and it's fully playable on its own. But there's more if you are willing to dive a bit deeper...</p>\r\n<p>Oceans also includes something which will break the seams of the scientific reality you've come to accept: The Deep. The Deep is a deck of 100 unique power cards that require an additional cost to play. These power cards range from things you might find in nature to the fantastical Kraken or Leviathan.</p>\r\n<p>Oceans is an engine builder where the world of science is disrupted at the seams by the world of fantasy. Players must adapt to the changing environment with an interconnected ecosystem that can survive and thrive against the inevitable march of time and the natural struggle of predators seeking to survive.</p>",

Each player represents one of the international companies who are gathering machineries, innovative patents, and brilliant engineers to claim the best locations to capture and exploit the water power of a contested Alpine region crossed by rivers.</p>\r\n<p><em>Barrage</em> includes two innovative and challenging mechanisms. First, the construction wheel has to be managed by players to carefully plan their actions and handle their machineries since both your action tokens and resources are stored on the wheel and come back only after a full wheel round is completed. The more you construct and perform maintenance on your wheel, the earlier that resources and actions return to you.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the water flow on the rivers depicted on the board is a shared and contested resource. Players have to intercept and store as much of the water as they can, build dams (upstream dams are expensive but can block part of the water before it reaches dams downstream), raise their dams to increase capacity, and build long tunnels to divert water to their powerhouses. Water is never consumed — its flow is just used to produce energy — and released in the rivers, so you have to strategically place your dams to recover water diverted by you and other players.</p>\r\n<p>Over five rounds, players must fulfill power requirements represented by a common competitive power track and meet specific requests of personal contracts. At the same time, by placing a limited number of engineers, they attempt to increase their machineries to acquire new and more efficient construction actions and to build and activate special unique effect buildings to customize their own developing strategy.</p>",

Realising the depth of chaos his father’s long reign had caused, the Longqing Emperor set about reforming the government by re-employing talented officials previously banished by his father. The Emperor resides in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. The Forbidden City is currently known as “Gùgõng” (Imperial Palace) by the people of China. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified and expanded. During this period, China was under heavy attack the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.</p>\r\n<p>The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. However, the Longqing Emperor tried to eradicate corruption as much as he could, by simply having it officially prohibited, and punishable by death.</p>\r\n<p>This measure seemed successful at first, but as we all know, it is not so simple to keep perfect control over one’s “loyal” subjects. At the imperial court, the highest officials would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, and instead of simply accepting money, a new custom saw the light of day: the exchange of gifts.</p>\r\n<p>If a petitioner visited an official to present a request, they would also present a gift. And naturally, the official would return the honour by presenting a gift in return. If the gift of the petitioner was something quite valuable, like, say, a Jade statue, and the return gift from the official was a cheap paper fan, it was hard to regard this as an act of bribery. However, both knew very well how valuable the symbolism of said item could be…</p>\r\n<p>“Gùgõng” uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. The players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by bribing certain officials responsible for certain tasks, by offering suitable gifts.</p>\r\n<p>A player wins by gaining an audience with the emperor. If several players succeed to do this, the player with the most VPs amongst those players wins the game.</p>",

Every turn you must choose a Role to execute (and like Glory to Rome or Puerto Rico, your opponents will get a chance to follow suit), and in doing so you will add one of those Role cards to your deck. When executing a Role, you can boost its effect by playing cards out of your hand matching the Role you have chosen.

Nasty goblins now pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving, and sacred, mushroom folk - and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...<br /><br />In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure nostalgic of old Nintendo games like The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins. <br /><br />Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.<br /><br />Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat, and by gryphon to get to all the places they need to go to satisfy their quests - or to position themselves for what night brings. Each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.<br /><br />During the night, players must face the challenges of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.<br /><br />The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner!</p>",

		"description": "<p>Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience. In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers around the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile. First, players are given insider information each round. This information dictates how a stock's value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time. Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line. Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your</p>",

But you do have a rich uncle, recently departed, who decided on his death bed to leave all his money to the relative who will enjoy it the most. To find out who that is, you and your cousins will each be given a substantial sum of money. Whoever can spend it the fastest will inherit all your uncle's wealth.<br /><br />Last Will is a race to bankruptcy. In each round, you choose a plan for the day, which determines how many options you will have available and how much time you will have for them. If you don't give yourself enough options, you might find yourself with nothing left to do after attending the theatre. If you don't set aside enough time, you might have to forgo dinner prepared by London's most famous chef or a carriage ride with a charming guest. And don't neglect your property investments. Or rather, do neglect them: Once your properties depreciate, you can sell them for a pittance, bringing you that much closer to bankruptcy. The upper class lifestyle provides you many opportunities to spend your uncle's money. Just be sure to spend it fast.<br /><br />A luxurious life of fabulous wealth is within your grasp. With your uncle's Last Will, bankruptcy leads to riches!</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Last Will</strong></em>, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.</p>\r\n<p>Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Take a card on display and add it to your hand.</li>\r\n<li>Draw a card from any regular deck – This can be chosen only once by each player.</li>\r\n<li>Visit the opera and spend $2.</li>\r\n<li>Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.</li>\r\n<li>Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses – of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! – to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.</p>\r\n<p>If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.</p>",

As they gain information about the location of the objects, they'll mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories. This is the way that players score points.</p>\r\n<p>As more and more objects are found, players will narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search.

Ingenious is an abstract tile-placement game in which the players take turns placing tiles in the shape of two connected hexagons into a hexagonal grid on the board. Each tile has two colored symbols on it. Players earn points in a specific color for each line of matching colored symbols that they extend when they place a tile. A player's final score is determined by his or her lowest scoring color, not the highest. The winner is the player whose lowest score is the highest compared to the other players' lowest scores, and not the player with the highest scoring color overall.<br /><br />The game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two hexagons connected along one side. Each hexagon has one of six colored symbols in it, with most tiles having two different colored symbols and some having two of the same colored symbol. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it. During his or her turn, each player places one tile from his or her rack onto two empty hexagonal spaces on the game board. For each of the two hexagons composing this tile, the player scores one point in the hexagon's color for each already-placed hexagon of the same color that radiates outward in a straight line from one of the placed hexagon's five sides. If a player's score in a color reaches 18, he or she immediately takes another turn. At the end of the turn, the player refills his or her rack to six tiles.<br /><br />When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.<br /><br />Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play. This highly awarded, international bestseller has been redesigned with a plastic board.</p>",

The airship module was originally created and shared in the Scythe Facebook group by Kai Starck. Jamey read over the rules and was impressed both by what the airships added to the game and by the effort Kai had put into the expansion through writing the rules and playtesting it. So Kai, Jakub, and Jamey collaborated to hone the airship module.<br /><br />In the airship module, 2 airship tiles are randomly paired at the beginning of the game (1 passive and 2 aggressive; there are 16 total tiles). Each player's airship miniature (a new type of unit; 1 big miniature for each of the 7 factions [the sculpts are identical, and the bases are different colors to match the factions]) has those abilities, as well as the core ability that airships are free to move onto any territory (land or water) and across rivers. Each player starts with their airship on their home base, so they can start moving out of their home area right away. The airship miniatures measure 104x34x42mm, and they have clear, plastic, removable stands/bases.<br /><br />In the resolution module, resolution tiles add a twist to the way each game ends. There are 8 of them, and 1 will be used each game. They often have an impact in the decisions you’ll make throughout the game.</p>",

The meadows on the other side of the River are to remain a recreational area for the City.<br /><br />But, with hopes of larger profits, investors and building tycoons entirely ignore the City Council's demands and begin developing three rows of buildings instead. The Mayor catches wind of the potential for profit and begins planning a new mansion in The Estates, which would double the value of one of the building rows! With some sketchy Building Permits, investors begin developing buildings on the other side of the River, beyond the designated building zone.<br /><br />However, the City Council takes rigorous steps to put an end to the racketeering with an ultimatum: as soon as the first two rows are completed, the buildings in the uncompleted row will be torn down, resulting in a huge loss for all who invested there. At the end of the day, the investor with the highest-valued buildings will come out on top! <br /><br /><strong>Contents:</strong><br />* 1 Game Board <br />* 36 Floor Cubes <br />* 12 Rooftops <br />* 6 Company Certificates <br />* 3 Building Permits <br />* 1 Cancel Cube <br />* 1 Mayor <br />* 2 Linen Bags <br />* 60 Checks <br />* 1 Rulebook</p>",

Trying to conclude something while drawing is not as easy as you think!<br /><br />Everyone will try to draw what the game master wrote on the prompt cards, but each player is only allowed to draw one line. For example, if the topic is &quot;cat&quot;, you could draw an ear or a whisker so that the other players know you know the topic. There is one fake artist among the players - someone who doesn't know the topic and will have to draw a line randomly.<br /><br />After each player has drawn twice, they will have to decide who the fake artist is. If the fake artist receives the most votes, that player loses. Otherwise, the fake artist and the game master win the game. Now, you might think it is extremely easy to find out who the fake artist is, but there is one more rule: Even if the fake artist receives the most votes, that player can still guess the topic of the picture everyone drew - and win with a correct guess!<br /><br />Knowing this rule, it becomes much more difficult for the real artists to draw their lines. You want to show the other artists that you know the topic of the picture, but you don't want to be too obvious in front of the fake artist - so the picture becomes a crazy mess!<br /><br /><strong>Contents:</strong><br />9 Title Cards<br />10 Color Pens<br />White Board Marker<br />Drawing Paper<br />Manual</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may only build one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route.</p>\r\n<p>Players start with a supply of 20 post offices in their color, a carriage house card and a player aid card. The board is populated with bonus tiles, carriage cards and city cards. On a turn a player will draw a card from a display of six, face up, city cards (or the top of the face down deck) and meld one card, either starting a new route or adding to the current one. If after adding to the route, the length of the route is at least three cities, the player may declare it finished and score it. The player may, depending on the length of the route and which cities are in the route, place post offices in the cities, collect bonus tiles, and acquire a higher value carriage. Optionally, the player may receive support from one postal official in the form of: drawing a second card, melding a second card, refreshing the six city card display, or acquiring a higher value carriage than the route length when finishing a route. Once a route is scored the city cards of that route are discarded, and the player begins a new route on his next turn.</p>\r\n<p>When a player exhausts his supply of post offices or acquires a value 7 carriage the end of the game is triggered. Play continues until the player who is last in turn order finishes his turn, and the game ends. Players score points for their highest valued carriage and bonus tiles, and lose points for unplaced post offices. The player with the most points wins.</p>\r\n<p>The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.</p>",

Sources for the finest books are scarce, so you'll need to beat your opponents to them when they pop up - especially if they match your library's secret focus!<br /><br />You only have a few days before the Mayor's Official Inspector comes to judge your library, so be sure your assistants have all your books shelved in time! She is a tough cookie, and will use her Official Inspection Form to grade your library on several criteria including alphabetical order, shelf stability, prominent works, and variety. And don't think she'll turn a blind eye to books the Council has banned! You'll need shrewd planning, cunning tactics, and perhaps a little magic to surpass your opponents and become Grand Librarian!</p>",

		"description": "<p><em><strong>Glen More II: Chronicles</strong></em> is a sequel to <em>Glen More</em>, expanding the gameplay substantially compared to the original game.</p>\r\n<p>In <em>Glen More II: Chronicles</em>, each player represents the leader of a Scottish clan from the early medieval ages until the 19th century, a leader looking to expand their territory and wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the right decision at the right time, be it by creating a new pasture for your livestock, growing barley for whisky production, selling your goods on the various markets, or gaining control of special landmarks such as lochs and castles.</p>\r\n<p>The game lasts four rounds, represented by four stacks of tiles. After each round, a scoring phase takes place in which players compare their number of whisky casks, scotsmen in the home castle, landmark cards, and persons against the player with the fewest items in each category and receives victory points (VPs) based on the relative difference. After four rounds, additional VPs are awarded for gold coins and some landmarks while VP penalties are assessed based on territory size, comparing each player's territory to the smallest one in play.</p>\r\n<p>The core mechanism of <em>Glen More II: Chronicles</em> and <em>Glen More</em> functions the same way: The last player in line takes a tile from a time track, advancing as far as they wish on this track. After paying the cost, they place this tile in their territory, with this tile activating itself and all neighboring tiles, triggering the production of resources, movement points, VPs, etc. Then the player who is last in line takes their turn.</p>\r\n<p>Improvements over the original <em>Glen More</em> include bigger tiles, better materials, new artwork, the ability for each player to control the end of the game, and balancing adjustments to the tiles for a better suspense curve. The game is designed to consist of one-third known systems, one-third new mechanisms, and one-third improvements to <em>Glen More</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The &quot;Chronicles&quot; in the title — a set of eight expansions to the base game — are a major part of these new mechanisms. Each Chronicle adds a new gameplay element to the base game. The &quot;Highland Boat Race&quot; Chronicle, for example, tells the story of a boat race in which the winner needs to be the first to reach their home castle after navigating their boat along the river through all the other players' territories. The &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot; Chronicle adds a neutral &quot;Englishman&quot; playing piece to the time track that players struggle to control to get an additional turn — if they can afford him, that is, as he is paid using the market mechanism. All Chronicles can be freely combined, although designer Matthias Cramer suggests that players use only one or two unless they want a &quot;monster game&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>Another major change to the game is the ability to invest in famous Scottish people of the time, who are represented through a new &quot;person&quot; tile type. Persons not only have their own scoring, they also trigger one-time or ongoing effects on the tactical clan board. This adds a new layer of decision making, especially since the ongoing effects allow players to focus on a personal strategy of winning through the use of the clan board.</p>\r\n<p><em>—description from the publisher</em></p>",

		"description": "<p><strong>Sidereal Confluence: Trading and Negotiation in the Elysian Quadrant</strong> is a unique trading and negotiation game.</p>\r\n<p>Over the course of the game, each race must trade and negotiate with the rest to acquire the resources necessary to fund their economy and allow it to produce goods for the next turn. While technically a competitive game, Sidereal Confluence has a uniquely cooperative feel during the trading phase as no race has the ability to thrive on its own. Trade well, and you'll develop technologies and colonize planets to form a civilization that is the envy of the galaxy.<br /><br />Each player chooses one of the nine unique and asymmetrical alien races that have come together to form a trade federation in their quadrant. Each race has its own deck of cards representing all the existing and future technologies it might research. Some races also have other cards related to unique features of their culture. These cards represent portions of the culture's economy and require spending some number of resources to use, resulting in an output of more resources, ships, and possibly victory points. Since each culture's outputs rarely match their inputs, players need to trade goods with one another to run their converters to create the resources they truly need to run their society most efficiently and have an effective economy. Almost everything is negotiable, including colonies, ships, VP and all kinds of resources. <br /><br />Each game round contains an open trading phase in which all players can negotiate and execute deals for resources, ships, colonies, even the temporary use of technologies! Players with enough resources can also research technologies, upgrade colonies, and spend resources on their race's special cards during this phase. Once complete, all players simultaneously run their economies, spending resources to gain more resources. The Convocation follows, starting with players sharing newly researched technologies with all other races and following with bidding to acquire new colonies and research teams. Researching a new technology grants many victory points for the prestige of helping galactic society advance. When one race builds a new technology, it is shared with everyone else. Technologies can be upgraded when combined with other technologies.<br /><br />The ultimate goal is victory points, which are acquired by researching technologies, using your economy to convert resources to goods, and converting your leftover goods into points at the end of the game.<br /><br />The game is almost all simultaneous play, keeping the game play moving.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Contents:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>390 Cards</li>\r\n<li>292 Wood pieces</li>\r\n<li>Dozens of tokens</li>\r\n<li>9 Player sheets detailing tips and advice on how to play a race</li>\r\n<li>Rulebook</li>\r\n</ul>",

The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items - such as books, ceramics, ornaments and relics - to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.</p>\r\n<p>Each player has a landscape with a Clay Mound, a Cloister Office, and a Farmyard, He receives livestock, grains, coins, or clay when he places his clergymen onto these buildings. How many goods he receives depends on the position of the goods indicator on the production wheel. Whenever a goods type is taken, the corresponding goods indicator is moved back to 0. Each time the production wheel is rotated at the start of a round, all production is increased.<br /><br />There are two other goods at the start of the game: wood and peat. These can only be obtained when a forest or moor card is removed from a player's landscape. Players can buy additional landscapes to add to their starting landscape. These landscapes can provide room to build buildings with building materials as well as settlements with food and energy. Some of the buildings are special cloister buildings. Since these must always be built adjacent to other cloister buildings, a cloister of ever-increasing size develops that the player can be rewarded for with the House of Brotherhood.<br /><br />The settlements are of special interest in the game. They must be cleverly built next to other buildings and settlements so that they are worth as many points as possible at the end of the game. Whoever has carried out God's work with prayer and hard work at the end of the game is the winner.<br /><br /><em>Ora &amp; Labora</em> includes two sets of game rules - a shorter, narrative set and a longer, more detailed set. A solo game lets players read the rules and immediately &quot;try out&quot; the game.</p>",

First, nearly every route on the game board is a double-route, with two tracks connecting cities. Both of these routes are in play no matter how many players are in the game.</p>\r\n<p>Second, every route — whether double or single — has a bridge toll that a player must pay when building on that route. On a single route or the first track of a double route, the player pays this toll — which costs 1-4 coins — to the bank; on the second track of a double route, the player pays this toll to the player who built the first track. Players start the game with 30 coins, and if you can't pay a toll, you must take a loan card to cover the fare, with each loan costing you 5 points at the end of the game.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to helping you avoid loans, coins matter because at game's end, players receive a bonus based on how many coins they hold relative to everyone else. In a five-player game, for example, the player with the most coins scores a 55 point bonus; the 2nd place player scores 35 points, and the other players 20, 10 and 0 points. If you've taken a loan, however, you're ineligible for this bonus scoring, so players have an incentive to build early and often.</p>\r\n<p>These coin bonuses are balanced by the multitude of destination tickets with large point values: six of them are worth 29+ points while another seventeen are worth 17-26 points.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

		"description": "<div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Black Orchestra</strong></em> begins with each player choosing a historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).</p>\r\n<p>But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.</p>\r\n<p>On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions — at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &quot;Conspire&quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.</p>\r\n<p>After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.</p>\r\n<p>To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.</p>\r\n<p>Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of its cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>",

The day of Empires has come.<br /> </em>– Joseph Chamberlain</p>\r\n<p>Rule the world and build an empire to withstand the test of time in <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization: A New Dawn! </em>This new tabletop game based on the groundbreaking video game series lets players become some of history’s greatest leaders as they try to advance their people through the ages, from ancient history to the modern era. Trade, battle, build, and pursue your agendas to become the premier world power!</p>\r\n<p>Designed by James Kniffen, <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization: A New Dawn </em>is a turn-based strategy board game for two to four players. As leaders of competing nations, players must expand their domains, gain new technologies, and build wonders to rise above all others and shape the world to their own vision. By balancing their nation's pursuits, leaders can build a new society greater than any that has come before and guarantee that their people will not only survive, but thrive.</p>\r\nLead Your People\r\n<p>At the start of each game, players draw a random leader card that they will embody for the duration of the game. Each leader comes with a unique focus bar setup to align with their nation’s historical pursuits, as well as a special ability to give them an edge other players won't have. Each player also receives a set of cities, caravans, control tokens, diplomacy cards, focus cards, and a tech dial.</p>\r\n<p>Next, players will build the land they will set out to conquer with map tiles, populating it with barbarians, natural resources, and city-states. While advancing their nation’s pursuits presents leaders with enough challenges, world events also occur periodically that affect the map and all of the players, such as barbarian attacks. Before each of the first player’s turns, the first player advances the event dial, possibly producing one of these events.</p>\r\nBuild Your Nation\r\n<p>The leaders’ goal is simple: to master this domain in order to become the leading world power. However, the exact method of their conquest changes with each game. These potential agendas are detailed on victory cards, three of which are set beside the map at the beginning of the game. Players race to complete one of the two agendas on each victory card. The first to accomplish this task wins the game.</p>\r\n<p>Players complete the agendas given on victory cards by accomplishing tasks in five different focus areas: culture, science, economy, industry, and military. Players organize their focus areas by constructing a focus bar at the beginning of the game, which is placed beneath each player’s leader card. A player’s turn revolves around the focus row of five cards below his or her focus bar.</p>\r\n<p>The focus row represents a nation’s various pursuits. Each focus row has five slots, one for each type of card. The cards within the focus row shift to different slots as the player takes turns to represent a nation’s investment of time in that particular project. A card resolved in the fifth slot has a greater impact than one resolved in the first slot, as more time was spent on that pursuit. Cards within the focus row generally shift toward the fifth slot until they are used, which is when it moves back to the first slot again. Over a series of turns, players use these cards to build their civilizations from single cities to sprawling empires filled with wonders and technology.</p>\r\nDefine Your Civilization\r\n<p>With a wide array of choices, leaders must choose what type of civilization they will build. There are five types of focus cards that players can use to advance their civilizations, indicated by an icon in the upper-left corner. Each player’s focus row contains one card of each type, starting with level “I” and advancing as their pursuits come to fruition. During the game, players can acquire advanced versions of their starting focus cards, which have greater impact on the game.</p>\r\n<p>A leader may choose to create a peaceful civilization defined by artistic and intellectual pursuits. For artistic pursuits, the culture focus cards allow players to place control tokens, which can expand their territory and claim resources. The card’s focus row slot also determines which types of terrain on which the player can place control tokens. For the intellectual, the science focus cards advance a player’s tech dial, allowing the player to discover new technologies. The dial advances spaces equal to the number of the science card’s focus row slot.</p>\r\n<p>Conversely, a leader may choose a competitive civilization that uses rival nations to advance its own agendas. Economy focus cards allow a player to interact with city-states and rival cities by moving caravans. The card’s focus row slot determines which terrain types the caravans can move into. The industry focus cards allow a player to build either a new city or a world wonder, which grants a powerful ability to the player who controls it. If building a city, the card’s focus row slot determines which types of terrain the player can consider whereas, if the player is building a world wonder, the focus row slot contributes toward the cost of that wonder.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, a leader can build a militaristic civilization that rises to prominence by conquering any empires that stand in its way. Military focus cards allow a player to either reinforce defenses or perform attacks to defeat barbarians, conquer city-states, and capture rival territory. The focus row slot affects either how many control tokens can be reinforced, or affects the strength of each attack. Reinforced control tokens offer some protection against barbarians and other players by increasing its own combat value as well as those of each adjacent friendly city and control token. Otherwise, a player may choose to become a great military leader and battle rival cities, claiming an enemy’s loot and world wonders for themselves.</p>\r\nLeave Your Mark\r\n<p>By advancing their culture, science, economy, industry, and military, rulers can ensure their nation’s survival through the ages. However, true leaders want their civilization to not only survive, but thrive by advancing their pursuits and completing agendas. To become the supreme world power, a player must complete at least one agenda on each victory card presented at the beginning of the game. At the start of the first player’s turn, if a player has completed one agenda on each victory card, that player wins and ensures that their civilization will continue to flourish.</p>\r\n<p>Will you conquer the world by spreading your influence, defeating enemy armies, or becoming the most technologically advanced nation in the world? Will you build a nation that will stand the test of time, or crumble into dust? The fate of your civilization rests in your hands.</p>",

Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination is beyond calculation, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives. <br /><br /><strong>Forbidden Stars</strong> challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same - to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You'll need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.</p>\r\n<p>Each round in <em>Forbidden Stars</em> is divided into three phases. In the planning phase, players take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board; the four types of order tokens that players can place correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play. In the operations phase, players reveal their tokens to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Dominate</strong>, draining friendly planets of their important resources</li>\r\n<li><strong>Strategize</strong>, purchasing cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities</li>\r\n<li><strong>Deploy</strong>, building cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units</li>\r\n<li><strong>Advance</strong>, moving units and attacking their enemies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The last phase of each round is the refresh phase, during which players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units wounded in battle.</p>\r\n<p>Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in <em>Forbidden Stars</em> is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action. The game's set-up also poses strategic opportunities. Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend. This intentional construction, along with the unique domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that players must work to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.</p>",

Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you saute them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Morels</strong></em>, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms – sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough – earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.</p>\r\n<p>Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead.<br /><br />Also published as 'Fungi' albeit there are minor variations between these versions</p>",

We fight for its soul. A.R.K. is aware that there will be countless employees - fools blinded by the corporate veil - who will resist. So be it. There is too much at stake here to protect the purposefully ignorant. We will consider those who side with Raxxon as part of Raxxon itself, and mark our words, Raxxon will burn.<br /><br />Stealth, the search, the fight, and the thrill of the hunt. Specter Ops: Shadow of Babel puts you and 1-4 friends in the middle of a war for society that's fought in the shadows. <br /><br />Specter Ops Board and Setup<br /><br />On one side, a lone A.R.K. agent infiltrates a Raxxon facility, seeking to retrieve three mission targets and escape alive. Equipped with unique skills and tools, the agent moves in secret.<br /><br />On the other side, two or more genetically enhanced Raxxon hunters, alerted to the intruder's presence, take no prisoners as they attempt to eliminate the A.R.K. agent before a successful escape. Super-human mutations and keen coordination aid them in their duty to destroy Raxxon's enemies.<br /><br />Each turn, the A.R.K. agent marks their moves secretly, indicating their board location only if they pass through a hunter's line of sight. If the A.R.K. player can collect three out of four mission objectives and escape without losing all their life points, they win. Four agents to choose from as well as 12 equipment cards means a variety of strategies and experiences are possible.<br /><br />The Raxxon hunters move every turn as well, and drive a vehicle that rushes across the board and detects the motion of the A.R.K. agent. Every time a hunter gets the A.R.K. agent in their line of sight, they have a chance to do damage to the agent. Four hunters, all with different powers, complement the four agents, and all eight characters are represented by high quality miniatures.<br /><br />Specter Ops: Shadow of Babel features a streamlined ruleset great for veteran and rookie gamers alike. Several game modes accommodate 2-5 players who must utilize strategy, deduction, and stealth to win. Plot your moves in secret or hunt down the intruder. Specter Ops is an exciting stealth game that belongs in every gamer's collection.<br /><br />Specter Ops: Shadow of Babel is published jointly by Plaid Hat Games and Nazca Games.</p>",

If any character dies prior to the summoning, then the game ends and you lose; once the Elder One is on the board, as long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win.</p>\r\n<p>The episodes are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.</p>",

In the height of its power Portugal controlled the sea trade from Brazil to Japan and attained overwhelming wealth with the trade monopoly on spices.<br /><br />The players represent wealthy trade dynasties that help to build up the Portuguese colonial empire.

Founding colonies and building factories helps them to build up an economic base.

The players are ambitious managers who are trying to impress the board of directors in order to achieve as high a position as possible in the company and secure their careers. With promotions come advantages at the factory, such as more space to store precious materials and greater prestige to accelerate your ascent. Through solid management, you must strive to shine next to your peers. You need to manage suppliers and supplies, improve automobile parts, innovate — anything to stay on the cutting edge, or getting your hands greasy on the assembly line in order to boost production. You must exercise wisdom in choosing which projects you should start, selecting only those that will give you the upper hand and shunning those that will bog you down or cause the unthinkable — failure — which would diminish you in the eyes of the board.</p>\r\n<p>Over the course of the game, you persuade the board and the factory tender to help you develop and improve automobile parts. You make shrewd use of the outside suppliers and the limited factory supplies in order to appropriate needed part when the suppliers come up short. Because the factory must run at optimum efficiency, production doesn't wait for you or for mistakes.</p>\r\n<p>Like the process itself, <em>Kanban: Automotive Revolution</em> proves to be both innovative and rewarding. Game mechanisms tightly tied to the automobile manufacturing theme include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The factory manager is a game-driven non-player character with two modes of play (&quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot;) to offer a friendly or more competitive gameplay environment.</li>\r\n<li>Two independent player-influenced game timers — the factory production cycle and work week clock — provide timing tension to the game, trigger intermediate scoring phases, and factor into the game end conditions.</li>\r\n<li>A simulation of the factory assembly line with spatial point-to-point movement adds an element to the game that requires optimal timing.</li>\r\n<li>A design and innovation department, leveraged to manipulate the value of the various car models and component upgrades produced within the factory, drives the economy of the game.</li>\r\n<li>Departmental training and certification tracks provide players a means to operate more efficiently.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you want a seat on the board someday, you need to show that you can keep a complex machine running smoothly, efficiently, with everything happening just at the right time. <em>Kanban: Automotive Revolution</em> is a pure Eurogame focused on economics and resource management that puts you in the driver's seat of an entire production facility, racing for the highest level of promotion.</p>",

Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring, they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of 5 markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove 3 of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory -- but also makes you weaker, because you have one less ring to play with. Very tricky!<br /><br />GIPF is the first and central game of GIPF, a series of 6 games for 2 players. TAMSK is the second game, ZRTZ the third, and DVONN the fourth. And this is YINSH! The Project is a system that makes it possible to combine games -- not only the games of the project itself, but literally any game or challenge. This system is based on the use of potentials.

		"description": "<p>Winner of the 2008 International Gamer Awards best two-player strategy game and nominated for numerous other awards, 1960: Making of the President is widely recognized as the best U.S. presidential election game ever published. Of course, the inspiration for this design derives from GMT's blockbuster card-driven game, <em>Twilight Struggle</em>. So we are pleased to announce that 1960 is coming home to GMT in an all-new edition, just in time for you to argue with your uncle over the 2016 presidential elections. <br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar, in 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of Kennedy or Nixon vying for the right to lead the United States during the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; the year 1960 is synonymous with great social upheaval and progress. The candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.<br /><br />The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960-a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon's lazy shave, President Eisenhower's late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state's electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.<br /><br />The GMT edition of 1960: Making of the President will benefit from the years of suggestions, variants and clarifications that have emerged from game play since the game was first published. However, this will fundamentally be the same great game that players already know and love.</p>",

Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice -- just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope -- if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond. </p><p>In the <i>Gloom</i> card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins. </p><p>Printed on transparent plastic cards, <i>Gloom</i> features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it! </p><p>For 2 to 4 players, ages 8 and up.</p><p></p>",

One hand holds a compass, the other a machete as you hack your way through the thick underbrush toward what you believe to be your final destination. The remaining members of your expedition follow behind you, watching out for any dangers lurking in the jungle around you. All of a sudden, you hear the cry of a jaguar as it leaps from seemingly nowhere onto the path behind you. A fellow explorer pulls out their gun to defend themselves, but realizes they're out of bullets too late. The jaguar is upon them and they are defenseless. Another companion pulls out their pistol and fires a single shot into the jaguar's skull, but their comrade is already gone. The jungle has met their expedition with loss after loss, but they must keep moving forward. If they can find El Dorado, it will all be worth it in the end.&quot;<br />Experience the thrill and danger of the lost expedition of Percy Fawcett to find the city of El Dorado. Manage a party of explorers with their own expertise as you make your way through the Brazilian jungle in search of the fabled city of El Dorado in <em>The Lost Expedtion</em>!<br /><br /><strong>Welcome to the Jungle</strong><br />In <em>The Lost Expedition</em> the goal is to make your way through the jungle and find the city of El Dorado before succumbing to the many dangers. Each expedition begins with three explorers, each with their own health and field of expertise, as well as a shared pool of resources for the journey. Rounds consist of a morning and evening phase in which cards are played in a path the expedition will follow as they make their way through the jungle.<br />Each card has its own effects that range from costing you resources, demanding clever use of your explorers' expertise, or bringing harm to a member of your party. The threat of death lurks around every tree, and the game is lost if all the members of your exploring party are dead. So, do you have the knowhow and strength to make it to El Dorado alive?<br /><br /><strong>Three Ways to Play</strong><br /><em>The Lost Expedtion</em> can be played in three different ways! You and several friends can take on the challenges of the Brazilian jungle together, you can go head to head in competition with one other player, or you can forgo another player entirely and challenge yourself to a solo game. You're sure to have fun whichever way you decide to play!<br /><br /><strong>Co-Op<br /></strong> In a Co-Op game, you and up to four other players can work together to find El Dorado. Each player will add cards to the path during the morning and evening phases. Each round will be lead by one of the players who will make final decisions regarding the fate of the explorers, and that mantle will pass at the beginning of a new round of play. Collaborate with the other players to reach the end of the game alive!<br /><br /><strong>Solo<br /></strong><em>The Lost Expedition</em> can also be played as a solitaire experience. You will alternate playing cards from the top of the deck and playing cards from your hand as you try to reach El Dorado before your expedition party is killed. Challenge yourself and see if you have what it takes to go it alone!<br /><br /><strong>Head to Head<br /></strong> Finally, face off against another player with the Head-to-Head rules. It's a race to El Dorado or a fight to be the last alive as you form two paths with the other player and take turns picking which path you wish to follow. The first person to reach the city or the last one alive is the winner! Note: In the 'head-to-head' rules, the diagram shows more cards than can legally be played. The rules-as-written are correct.</p>\r\n</div>",

During the game players will drop additional action cubes into the tower - but some of these cubes might get stuck in the floors of the tower while other cubes already in the tower are knocked free.

Players sail their ships through the landscape created for this game, landing on islands to plan and build settlements, which then supply resources and allow the player to earn victory points.

In desperation and for the survival of the species, she sent Earth's massive worldship on a decade-long journey to uncharted space. Their destination was the fringes of the galaxy, where there was a chance to gain a foothold and grow in strength again, and perhaps find new allies for the fight against the Znu and Decima empires. Learning of this plan, the great empires sent their own worldships, following Earth to the edge, determined to stake their own claim and win the war for the fringe.<br /><br />In Empires of the Void II, each player has been given command of a mission by an alien empire to establish a foothold at the fringe of the galaxy. The game begins when their massive Worldships reach the fringe, where they must explore, wage war, use diplomacy, and construct buildings to gain victory. The fringe is sparsely populated, and many of the sentient species here are struggling to survive, leaving huge regions of planets open for exploration and colonization. Many species are eager to ally themselves with a powerful empire to gain security and stability in a chaotic and difficult time.</p>",

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (“One! One! One!”, or “Three! Three! Three!”) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring “Corner on Wheat!” or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.</p>\r\n<p>The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.</p>\r\n<p>Pit’s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt’s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit. In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903. Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull. Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.</p>",

Most of the cash has been hidden away, and the rest has been invested in businesses throughout the city. Everything is going according to plan until the police get a breakthrough in their investigation. Accusations are made, fingers are pointed, and after a heated argument, you decide to go your separate ways.<br />\r\n Chaos ensues as the SWAT team is called in and start to close off the city’s exits. Your only choice now is to escape the city before it is completely locked down. But you need a plan — a good route that allows you to leave the city while recovering as much of the money as possible.<br />\r\n You will need to call in some favors and hire the local gangs to create diversions. Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn't cheap. Disguises may help, but they don’t fool everyone. Setting the Police on the trail of your former colleagues will give you a better chance of escape, but the other thieves are thinking the same thing...<br />\r\n <p>Will you escape the city with the most money, or will the Police lockdown the city before you can escape?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops' moves every turn. The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves. The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan — by force if necessary. The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down. The players take actions that allow them to move and to engage gangs, mules, and snitches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a tactical game with no direct conflict, it contains asymmetric roles set by missions that players may achieve during the game while avoiding the police. The players' roles as thieves are individual with every player for themselves. In the end, only the player who escapes with the most cash wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game design is influenced by great heist films.</p>",

		"description": "<p><strong>Backgammon</strong> is a classic abstract strategy game dating back thousands of years. Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Backgammon</strong> may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.</p>\r\n<p>The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.</p>\r\n<p>It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).</p>\r\n<p>The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.</p>",

Take great caution to avoid your opponents' ships ... and those mysteries lurking on the horizon and under the sea. Guide your ship with a steady hand and be the last captain sailing to survive the mystic seas and win!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The basic game play of <em><strong>Tsuro of the Seas</strong></em> resembles that of Tom McMurchie's <em>Tsuro</em>: Players each have a ship that they want to sail — that is, keep on the game board — as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.</p>\r\n<p>Each turn players add &quot;wake&quot; tiles to the 7×7 game board; each tile has two &quot;wake connections&quot; on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.</p>\r\n<p>What's new in <em>Tsuro of the Seas</em> are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. Notably, daikaiju can move: each tile has five arrows, four for moving in each of the cardinal directions and another one for rotation. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then makes a second roll, this time with a single die. On 1-5 in the second roll, each daikaiju moves according to its matching arrow. On a 6 in the second roll, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.</p>\r\n<p>If a daikaiju tile hits a wake tile, a ship, or another daikaiju tile, the object hit is removed from the game. Another way to be ousted! The more daikaiju tiles on the game board, the faster players will find themselves trying to breathe water...</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Each player starts with a small set of cards. Cards come in two general types, location cards and empire cards. You can add an empire card to your discard pile simply by taking one as an action. Adding a location card is a little more involved. Each location card has a list of locations that it connects to and the transport type required to move to each of those locations. To take control of a neutral location you would have to play a location card with that neutral location on it, then a card that has the correct transport symbol, and then possibly a card with a settler symbol on it if required. You then place a cube in the location and add the location card to your discard pile.</p><p>Players take it in turns to perform two actions. There are a range of actions available, such as settling new locations, besieging locations, trading fur, launching Indian raids, and building fortifications. There are also cards that allow you to perform actions to manage your deck, such as getting rid of useless cards and drawing additional cards from your pile. You can also place cards in reserve so that you can use them at a later point in time.</p><p>The game ends if a player manages to capture his opponent’s capital city or he has managed to place all of his village or town pieces on the board. In the latter case points are calculated to see who wins.</p><p>The game can last from between 30 minutes to two hours, depending on how well players pursue the victory conditions.</p>",

		"description": "<p>K2 is the second-highest mountain on Earth as well as the second deadliest. It's known as the Savage Mountain, as it kills one person for every four who have reached the summit.. Now your team stands in its shadow, ready to climb for fame and glory. You know the dangers of K2 all too well. Extreme weather with frequent and deadly storms, exposed, steep, tricky routes and lack of oxygen await you on your way to the summit. You will test your climbing skills to death, try to outsmart the ever-changing weather and always worry about the acclimatization of your 2 mountaineers. Also there are the other teams ready to take the glory for themselves. K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team. You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers. K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike. The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).</p>",

Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples.  The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.<br /><br />The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors.  Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:<br /><br />-Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.<br />-Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.<br />-Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.<br />-Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.<br /><br />After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food!<br /><br />You score points for eating meeples, collecting floors and teeth,  and for achieving the goal on your character card.<br /><br />In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.<br /><br />",

Around 50 project cards and 5 corporations are added, with a special focus on how to make Venus habitable. With the new floater resource, a new milestone, a new award, a new tag, and a new terraforming parameter, players are given more paths to victory and an even more varied play.</p>\r\n<p>Here’s what’s new in this expansion:</p>\r\n<p><strong>49 new project cards</strong> – These are added to the main deck and function just like the other cards of the deck. However, they introduce some new strategies, most notably the floater strategy. Floater resources represent infrastructure which floats on the thick clouds of Venus. There is nothing special rules-wise with floaters, they work just like animal- and microbe resources, but there are many cards in Venus Next which allows adding floaters to other cards. So there are many exciting combinations to discover. Some cards also feature the new Venus tag, which – again – doesn’t add any new rules, but creates more interesting combinations to play with.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5 new corporation cards</strong> – did we mention variety? 5 new corporations means there is a lot of new replayability coming with this expansion. Some of them of course mesh well with the new floater resources and Venus tags, but a couple are also perfect for the base game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>An additional milestone and award tile</strong> – these are added as a sixth milestone and a 6th award, regardless of if you play the base game map or the Hellas &amp; Elysium expansion maps. Only 3 map be claimed as usual, but there are more to choose from.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Venus side board</strong> – This is placed beside the main board and features 4 new locations for Venusian, Mercurian, and even Lunar cities. But mainly, it introduces a new terraforming parameter which works exactly like the temperature and oxygen scale of the main game. It represents the overall terraforming of Venus. Increasing the parameter yields 1 Terraform Rating, and there are bonus steps giving additional benefits, just like the other parameters. The only difference is that the Venus track doesn’t have to be fulfilled for the game to end. It is an optional source of Terraform Rating.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A new game phase</strong> – after the production phase, the Solar Phase is introduced. In this phase, the World Government aids the terraforming by having the first player increase any of the 4 terraforming parameters without getting any of the bonuses of that increase. This effectively lets the game take approximately the same play time as with only the base game, but with a lot more variety and more strategies to discover.</p>\r\n<p>Welcome to Venus!</p>",

It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.",

Spurred on by the establishment of a new centralized military power, daimyos throughout Japan pledge their loyalty and make tentative alliances in a 7-week conflict which would decide the fate and ruler of all Japan. But the conflict arises more suddenly than anyone could anticipate. Loyalties will be tested, strategies developed on the fly, and battles decided by the cunning and courage of their commanders.<br />Assume the role of Tokugawa Ieyasu or Ishida Mitsunari in the battle that turned the tides and led to the founding of the Tokugawa Shogunate. This is <em>Sekigahara</em>!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Muster the Troops and Plan your Strategy!</strong><br /><em>Sekigahara</em> is a beginner-friendly wargame played over a series of 7 rounds, 1 for each week of the historic contest. The game begins with players setting up their armies and drawing their hand of cards from their faction's deck. Some designated troops are assigned to important locations on the map, but each game will have players assign some number of troops randomly. Troops are deployed so that players can only see the type and number of their own troops. This element of random deployment and secrecy creates an air of tension between the players.<br />With troops assigned, players can begin planning their strategy and implementing their campaign to take control of Japan. Move your armies along the highways and take control of important locations to gain resources and reinforcements that will help you to win your battles.<br /><br /><strong>Martial Contests of Loyalty and Honor!</strong><br />Battles will decide the fate of the two armies, and loyalties will be tested as players overrun their enemies with superior forces, test the loyalties of each other's retainers, and rally to siege castles and take out the opposing commander.<br /><br /><strong>Muster the Troops<br /></strong> Players will move their armies across the board to take key locations and bolster their forces in the battles to come. They are given the option to muster new forces to assist them in future battles, hoping to turn the tides in their favor if it's in the cards.<br /><br /><strong>Engage in Battle<br /></strong> Take turns passing initiative and playing cards to deploy troops into battle. A players hand of cards is a precious resource that will help them better plan their movements and prepare for battle. Play a card with a symbol which matches your troop to deploy it into battle. Some cards even enable certain troops to engage special attacks, increasing their impact on the battle. Whichever player generates more impact will win the battle and force their foe to take losses and retreat. But things are not as simple as they seem.<br /><br /><strong>Challenge Loyalty<br /></strong> Troops are hidden from your opponent until they are deployed, so it is impossible to know how a battle will resolve. It all comes down to the troops involved and the loyalty cards the players hold. Some cards will allow a player to challenge the loyalty of an opposing troop. If the challenge succeeds, the troop will swap sides and fight for you until the end of the battle. Treachery and loyalty defined the conflict at <em>Sekigahara</em>, and your battles will be the same.</p>\r\n<p>COMPONENTS:<br />Mounted Map<br />119 wooden pieces<br />1 and 1/2 sticker sheets<br />110 cards<br />Rulebook<br />Two player aid cards</p>\r\n</div>",

Players make secret plans to travel to parts of the Grimm Forest to gather limited amounts of resources that are available there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is played over multiple rounds, split between two main phases: gather and build. During the gather phase, you will move to one of the gather locations; there, you will gather resources to use in your house-building efforts. If more than one pig goes to the same location, you must share the resources found there, but if you end up alone, you get all the resources from that site.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers may choose to secretly play up to one fable card from their hand. By accurately deducing the actions of other players, the correct fable card can be played to enhance the number of resources gathered by you or slow the process of building for others. At different points during the game, allies come out of the Grimm Forest to help players meet their goal through the friend cards, which grant them powerful, permanent abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce everyone has selected the cards they want to play, the cards are revealed, and the pigs are placed on their chosen locations. Fable cards are then played, one at a time, following the order of activation. Once all cards have been played, players take or share their resources and place them on their player boards, ready to be used in the build phase of the round.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first player to build three complete houses wins!",

The year is 1894 and the Snowdon Mountain Tramroad and Hotels Company Limited has been formed to build a branch line from Llanberis to the summit. You can scarcely believe it's possible! In Snowdonia players represent work gangs providing labor for the construction of the Snowdon Mountain Railway. Unlike other train games you will have to excavate your way up a mountain side, as well as make and lay the track, construct viaducts and stations. All this in competition with the weather of the Welsh mountains (and the game itself)! You may be assisted by a train (though that's not always best) and you'll be able to collect essential materials from the Stock Yard. You will obtain special work contracts that give you bonuses. Can you contribute more than the other players to the magnificence of the Snowdon Mountain Railway?</p>",

The setup can be prepared by using a special card scanning app, or by players selecting words for each other. Each player then puts their first card in their stand facing the other players without looking at it, and the game begins.</p>\r\n<p>The game is played in turns. Each turn, players simultaneously search other players’ letters to see what words they can spell out (telling the others the length of the word they can make up). The player who offers the longest word can then be chosen as the clue giver.</p>\r\n<p>The clue giver spells out their clue by putting numbered tokens in front of the other players. Number one goes to the player whose letter comes first in the clue, number two to the second letter etc. They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents.</p>\r\n<p>Each player with a numbered token (or tokens) in front of them then tries to figure out what their letter is. If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter. At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word. All players then reveal their cards to see if they were successful or not. The more players who have an existing word in front of them, the bigger their common success.</p>",

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent’s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.</p>\r\n<p>The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings – or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.</p>\r\n<p><em>Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends</em> offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.</p>\r\n<p>In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.</p>\r\n<p>The rules of <em>Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends</em> are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Tsar Ivan wants to see results and our team will prove to him that we are the best builders in the city. We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the government’s trusted workers.</p>\r\n<p><em>Sheila Santos</em> and <em>Israel Cendrero</em> make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice. To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. <em>Pedro Soto</em> (Holmes, Sherlock &amp; Mycroft, Papua) and <strong>Chema Román</strong> (El mundo de Águila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>The Red Cathedral</strong></em> is a strategic, “Euro” board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil's cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.</p>\r\n<p>During the game, the players can carry out <strong>one of these three actions</strong>: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources. Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.</p>\r\n<p>When the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section. The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.</p>\r\n<p>The players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.</p>\r\n<p>The game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.</p>\r\n<p><em>The Red Cathedral</em> is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

		"description": "<p>In this deck-building game, you have no hand at all! Instead, you play the card directly from the top of your deck. Winning the game requires delicate strategies and some luck as well!<br /><br />A turn consists of 2 phases: Card Playing and Building Phase.<br /><br />Players play cards directly from the top of their deck, and may choose to continue until they have 3 cry-face icons in play, which ends their turn immediately. When they choose to stop, move on to the Building Phase.<br /><br />During the Building Phase players can use the coins gained from the previously played cards to buy a new card or upgrade a card in your discard pile. To upgrade a card, a player pays the cost and flips it over, upgraded cards remain in your discard pile.<br /><br />Since all cards in this game are double-sided, be careful not to flip them over accidentally when you place cards into your discard pile, and also when shuffling your deck.<br /><br />Whenever a player gains 8 or more VP during a single card playing phase, the player wins immediately!</p>",

You and your fellow medical graduates have been called up to the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to eliminate Soviet operatives, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.<br /><br />Combatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it's not the only threat you'll encounter in the field. Soviet agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won't be without backup. Coordinate with other covert CIA operatives for assistance - they're particularly effective at making Soviet spies disappear...quietly. Make strategic use of CIA teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.<br /><br />Designed as a prequel, <strong>Pandemic Legacy: Season 0</strong> does not require you to have completed Season 1 and Season 2 before diving into this Cold War spy thriller. As in the first two Pandemic Legacy games, each time you play brings new cards, rules, and conditions that affect future games. Each alias you create will gain contacts and other assets to execute your plans more smoothly. And, of course, the CIA will be watching and evaluating your performance in the field. Work together with your fellow agents to prevent this new bio-threat - the fate of the world depends on it. Can you save humanity once again?</p>",

Even the greatest kingdoms begin as small townships, therefore players begin with only a basic town hall, a couple of peons, and a single warrior.

Peons become warriors, warriors become powerful heroes, and town halls eventually become castles. Players gain access to water, and even air, vessels and creatures.

The command playing cards supply those orders, providing an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities. You must maximize your opportunities by playing your command cards judiciously. How well you handle the diverse units, their weapons, and the terrain, will determine victory.<br /><br />Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients contains the battles of Akragas, Crimissos River, Ticinus River, Lake Trasimenus, Cannae, Dertosa, Castulo, Baecula, Ilipa, and Zama.</p>",

She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor. Eventually, she will have to come to a decision. Which Order will prove itself worthy to decide on her successor? There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;LUNA&quot; is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.</p>\r\n<p>The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the &quot;worker movement&quot; principle, i.e. they aren’t placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you’re in the right place at the right time, you’ll gain the deciding influence points. You’ll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess’ divine services. But don’t forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests – these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;LUNA – On the Isles of the Moon Priestess&quot; is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements. It’s a game for 1-4 players aged 12 and up, and takes about 20-25 minutes per player. The different placement of the islands and novices at the beginning of the game creates a different feeling each time you play and opens up new strategies.</p>",

It is set in an environment loosely modeled on Italy in the late Middle Ages. Players choose their own victory condition: they can focus on population growth, trade, conquest, or city building by choosing their patron saint. Each strategy requires a completely different style of play. Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all - but you'll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player. While your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials - until finally, there is no more land left to farm.

Gameplay is driven by the innovative cascading production system. Timing and tactics are key as you work to restore your home to its former glory and win the crown!</p>\r\n<p>Working on the same game board with the other players (but beginning at your own entrance), you'll dig a competing network of tunnels by spending increasingly valuable materials to lay polyomino tiles onto the map. You want to extend your tunnels to connect with buried gold and materials, with workshop locations that can transform resources, and especially with toppled statues. Statues are key to scoring, and you'll spend carts to move them through the tunnels to prime scoring locations near the heart of the mountain.</p>\r\n<p>A major aspect of the game is the cascading production. You begin with a line of four trolls, and every troll shows the combination of resources — gold, stone, iron, marble, carts, runes, and hammers — that it produces. When a new troll is hired, place it above two other trolls, forming a &quot;pyramid&quot;. The new troll activates, gaining its resources, and any trolls beneath it ALSO activate, gaining any resources that they have room to carry. In this way as you hire more trolls, you gain bigger and bigger windfalls of resources as the end of the game nears. The timing of your hiring turns versus your building turns is important as you try to maximize your cascades while making sure you get the trolls you want from the shared market and also stay competitive on the map.</p>\r\n<p>The game ends shortly after the last player hires their sixth troll, then the player with the most honor (earned for digging tunnels of increasing quality, for excavating great halls, and for moving statues closer to the heart of the mountain, especially onto matching pedestals) is crowned the Mountain King and wins!</p>",

		"description": "<p>Days of Wonder's <em>Ticket to Ride Map Collection</em> is a series of expansions for Alan R. Moon's <em>Ticket to Ride</em>, with each expansion including a double-sided game board and destination tickets and rules for those locations.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 1 - Team Asia &amp; Legendary Asia</strong></em> presents players with two set-ups on Earth's largest continent:</p>\r\n<p>• <em>Team Asia</em> from Alan R. Moon – Four or six players compete as two-player teams, with teammates sitting next to one another at the table. Each player has her own secret hand of cards and tickets, in addition to some cards and tickets being placed in a shared cardholder that either player on the team can access.</p>\r\n<p>When a player draws cards, she must place one card in the cardholder and the other in her hand (unless she takes a face-up locomotive, in which case it must be shared); when a player draws tickets, the first ticket kept must be placed in the cardholder and any additional tickets kept added to her hand. A player can spend her turn to add two tickets from her hand to the cardholder. A team's points are tracked collectively, and the team with the highest score wins.</p>\r\n<p>• <em>Legendary Asia</em> from François Valentyne – The main change in this set-up is that some of the routes through Asia are labeled mountain routes, with one or more spaces on the route bearing an X. Whenever a player claims one of these routes, she must place a train from her reserve in the Mountain Crossing area of the game board, earning two points for each such train but losing access to them for the rest of the game. The player who connects to the most cities in a single network earns a ten point &quot;Asian Explorer&quot; bonus.</p>\r\n<p><em>Ticket to Ride</em> or <em>Ticket to Ride: Europe</em> is required to use the maps in this expansion</p>",

Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Raul, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans' deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar. Castro's takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.<br /><br />Following up on GMT Games' Andean Abyss, the COIN Series next volume, <strong>Cuba Libre</strong>, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution. Castro's Marxist \"26 July Movement\" must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana. Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and ex-patriots try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro. Batista's Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors: its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim. And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive. <br /><br />Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players-both volumes share the same innovative COIN system. Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4-and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss. But Cuba Libre's situation and strategic challenges will be new. A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life.</p>",

Viking players either play as Norsemen Viking freeman or as the fearless Viking shock troops known as Berserkers. The English play as the Housecarl, the Kings’ household troops, or as the Thegns who were regional noble Leaders. The English players will also be able to call up the peasant levies, called the Fyrd, to defend their cities.</p>\r\n<p>Players for each side strategize together in order to coordinate their strategies. Each side attempts to control Cities on the map to win. The English start the game controlling all of England but a Viking Leader will invade from the sea each Turn.

Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle. Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources. Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand. This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight.

		"description": "<p>A funny bluff game with creatures that no one likes! The player on whom four cards of a kind are palmed off will lose this amusing bluff game. One player offers a card to another player stating what creature is pictured on it - correctly or incorrectly. The player who misjudges the other ends up with the card. &quot;This is a stink bug!” You can peek at the card and pass it on: &quot;Oh no, it‘s a spider!” True or false - who knows? Are you a good bluffer?</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>As in its parent game <em>Kakerlakenpoker</em>, <em><strong>Kakerlakenpoker Royal</strong></em> has nothing to do with poker – except that the game is all about bluffing, but with cards showing cockroaches, rats and stink bugs instead of queens, 10s and aces. To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players. On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., &quot;Stink bug&quot;. The player receiving the card either:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Accepts the card</strong>, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Passes the card to another player</strong>, peeking at it first, then keeping it face-down and either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must accept it and make a true/false claim.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.</p>\r\n<p>To this, <em>Kakerlakenpoker Royal</em> adds new rules and new nasty &quot;royal&quot; critters to create more options for players during the game.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

		"description": "<p><em>Four millennia ago on the eastern bank of the Nile river was laid the foundation of the Temple of Amun-Ra. Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as &quot;The Most Select of Places&quot; (</em>Ipet-Isut<em>), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Join ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.</em></p>\r\n<p>The game board in <em><strong>Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun</strong></em> is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (<em>Tekhenu</em>) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.</p>\r\n<p>The game takes place over multiple rounds, following this pattern:</p>\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2 Rounds</td>\r\n<td> = </td>\r\n<td>1 Rotation</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2 Rotations</td>\r\n<td> = </td>\r\n<td>1 Maat phase</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2 Maat phases</td>\r\n<td> = </td>\r\n<td>1 Scoring</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2 Scorings</td>\r\n<td> = </td>\r\n<td>1 Game</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Each round, you draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. At the beginning of the game, each of the six sections contains three dice. However, as dice are drafted and eventually refilled, the different sections will contain a varying number of dice.</p>\r\n<p>Dice come in five colors: white, yellow, black, brown, and gray. Depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow, each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.</p>\r\n<p>When drafting a die, you must consider not only the general availability of dice — if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section — but also which value die to draft and how your chosen die will affect the overall balance when the Maat phase occurs. An imbalance in favor of Purity carries no negative outcome whereas a Tainted imbalance may result in the loss of victory points. A perfect balance between Pure and Tainted dice, however, results in a more favorable turn order.</p>\r\n<p>After drafting one die and placing it on your player board (either on the Pure or Tainted side), you perform an action, the effect of which depends on the value of the die you selected.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Horus</strong><br />Taking the Horus god action allows the building of statues, either in honor of one of the gods or for the people. Building a statue in honor of a god grants you benefits when other players perform actions associated with that god. Building a statue for the people grants favorable benefits during scoring.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ra</strong><br />When taking the Ra god action, you add a pillar to the Amun-Ra temple grid, scoring victory points and gaining resources and possibly powerful bonus actions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hathor</strong><br />The Hathor god action results in the construction of buildings around the Amun-Ra temple complex, providing rich resources and considerable influence during scoring. This action also increases the current population.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bastet</strong><br />By taking the Bastet god action, a festival takes place, increasing the happiness of the people. However, the happiness marker can never overtake the population marker, making it necessary to strike a balance between different actions. Keeping your people happy unlocks powerful one-time benefits as well as bonus victory points during scoring and more options when taking the Thoth god action.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thoth</strong><br />The game includes three types of cards: blessings, technologies, and decrees. Taking the Thoth god action allows you to gain these cards, the type of which is determined by the happiness of your people. Also, the happier your people are, the greater the selection of cards available from which you can choose.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Osiris</strong><br />Taking the Osiris god action allows you to construct workshops and quarries, each of which increases your production of one of the four resources: papyrus, bread, limestone, and granite. During scoring, you are rewarded for having the most workshops or quarries of each type.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Production</strong><br />Instead of these six god actions, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color of the die (yellow = papyrus, brown = bread, white = limestone, and black = granite) and the current production value of that resource.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong><br />During each scoring, you are rewarded victory points:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For having the most workshops or quarries of each type.</li>\r\n<li>For buildings constructed near the Amun-Ra temple complex.</li>\r\n<li>Based on the number of statues you have constructed.</li>\r\n<li>Based on the happiness of your people.</li>\r\n<li>For having constructed a large number of buildings (whether near the temple complex or as workshops or quarries).</li>\r\n<li>For achieving maximum production.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>However, you must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain your population or else you suffer negative consequences. Additionally, after the second and final scoring, you can earn bonus victory points from various decrees you have collected during the game.</p>",

On their turn, each player can explore further into the dungeon (turn over new tiles), move through the already explored parts of the dungeon, and fight monsters. When a new dungeon tile is revealed, there is typically an encounter of some sort, and new monsters to fight are added. Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play. Players must cooperate to stay alive, slay the monsters, and achieve the goal of their quest. Each scenario has a different goal - from retrieving a relic, to slaying a vampire lord.</p>",

Colored sand is laid to create a symbolic map of the world before the pattern is ceremonially destroyed and the sand cast into the river.</em></p>\r\n<p>In the two-player game <em>Mandala</em>, you are trying to score more than your opponent by collecting valuable cards — but you won't know which cards are valuable until well into the game! Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields. As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their &quot;river&quot; and &quot;cup&quot;. At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player's river. The player whose cup is worth more points wins.</p>\r\n<p>The linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one &quot;field&quot; for each player. The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.</p>\r\n<p>To begin, each player receives a hand of six cards. Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala.</p>\r\n<p>On your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields. All cards played into a mandala must follow the &quot;Rule of Color&quot;: Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area. Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can't play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain. If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards.</p>\r\n<p>A mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards. When this happens, the players &quot;destroy&quot; the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color. Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first. The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup. The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>Once a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues.</p>\r\n<p>The end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river.

That serenity was shattered this morning with the discovery of the lifeless body of Brother Adelmo at the foot of the Monastery's cliffs. Did the usually nimble-footed Brother slip to his death? Or did someone help him in his fall? Mystery of the Abbey is a new kind of &quot;whodunit&quot; game of deduction and intuition, set in a medieval abbey. The game is brought to you by Days of Wonder. Players compete and collaborate to solve the mystery by moving through the Abbey's beautifully rendered board and questioning their brethren. Gameplay is in turn fun, captivating and tense; the atmosphere, vivid; the immersion, complete. Constant interactivity between the players, intelligent questioning and dynamic intrigue make Mystery of the Abbey the game of choice for an hour of fun with friends and family alike. The game is for 3 to 6 players ages 8 and up, and takes 60-90 minutes to play.</p>",

		"description": "<p>Talisman is an adventure board game set in a high fantasy medieval world. Players have 14 characters to choose from all based on role playing archetypes, such as heroes, wizards, villains, thieves, monsters, etc. The game makes players feel they are traveling the world to find equipment, weapons, ancient relics, and companions that will help them on their quest to acquire the Crown of Command. Along the way they visit various locales in the worlds, battle each other and fantastic creatures to make their way to the top.</p>\r\n<p>Goal:</p>\r\n<p>Each player is trying to move from the outer world and ultimately to the inner world. Players wander the outer, middle, and inner worlds trying to acquire equipment, weapons, and companions. They will also improve statistics with equipment, companions, and encounters and battles with fantasy creatures and each other. Once they complete a Talisman quest, players will enter the inner world and face its challenges to finally reach the Portal of Power to claim the Crown of Command. Then the other players must race to stop this player before he eventually kills them all with the Command spell.</p>\r\n<p>Gameplay:</p>\r\n<p>To begin, players select a character card from among the 14 provided. Characters have basic statistics to start. These are Life [hit points], Strength [physical prowess], and Craft [Magic and Intelligence]. Some characters are naturally more gifted in combat and others in magic, while others are mix of the two. Additionally characters are often differentiated with unique abilities, starting equipment, and starting spells. This all makes the players actually feel different during play. In addition items and companions players acquire during play also add to statistics, increasing Strength, Craft, Life or adding new abilities, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Actual game play is relatively simple, making the game easy to pick up with novices. On a player's turn they throw a die for movement. Player then chooses which direction, left or right, or if meeting qualifications may be able to move from outer to middle world, or middle to inner world. Once on space, player follows instructions on space, or encounters face up cards already in space, or other player if in space. Most spaces have a player draw a number of cards to encounter. These can be creatures, companions, weapons, equipment, treasure, or relics. Players must fight creatures and win before acquiring any other items or companions. If another player is in the space, players may attack with either Craft or Strength but are not required to do so. The defender defends with same statistic attacked with. If the defender loses, he loses a life and an item or companion of attackers choice. If the attacker loses, he loses a life.</p>\r\n<p>Players start in the outer world, and build up their character's statistics and items to try and move to the middle world. There are two ways to move up to the middle world, one requiring a test of strength and the other a boat man's ride for a price. Once in the middle world, play proceeds in the same manner, but the challenge generally is increased with more threats such as the desert and temple. However, there is more potential for encounters and items as most spaces now draw more than one card.</p>\r\n<p>In the middle world, players may also acquire a Talisman quest, that once completed, will grant them a Talisman. The Talisman is required to unlock the Crown of Command and pass through the Portal of Power in the Inner World.</p>\r\n<p>Once players have a Talisman and have enough Strength or Craft to enter the Portal of Power, they will try to enter the Inner World. There they must face and survive the guardians there, like the Vampire's Tower and Werewolf before claiming the Crown of Command. Once a player claims the Crown of Command, they can cast the Command Spell, automatically forcing a player to lose a life. It then becomes a race for the Crown as the other players try to take the player with the Crown down before he finishes them all off.</p>",

Epic is a card game designed to start quickly but also to reward deep, strategic plays. In Epic, you take on the role of an elder god, in conflict with other elder gods. The cards in your deck are your champions, who fight for you, and events, which represent your will imposed on the mortal realm. In Epic, the turn sequence is easy but there are many options to choose from. You begin the game with a hand of five cards – each card costs either one gold or is free. You get one gold each turn — you don't need to draw special resource cards or energy cards just to play with your other cards. Instead of figuring out which cards you might be allowed to play, you choose which card you want to play. Epic is non-collectable, so every box contains the same 120 unique event and champion cards, with 8 double-sided cards to represent temporary &quot;token&quot; champions. One box supports reconstructed, sealed and draft formats for 2-4 players, two boxes up to 8 players, and three if you want to create a full constructed deck or a &quot;cube&quot; environment for drafting.</p>",

The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core). The deeper you take actions, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased. Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next. You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever. With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!",

Send and defend against armies and minions, build towers to protect your base, and explore with your heroes in search of resources and powerful Relics to turn the tide of battle.</p>\r\n<p>Taking place in the floating realm of Ankar, <em>Cloudspire</em> tells the story of a war to acquire a powerful and rare energy known only as &quot;the source.&quot; Every race has their own unique units and heroes as well as the ability to bid and draft mercenaries for hire.</p>\r\n<p>Armies are placed either individually or in stacks to conceal powerful units until the last possible moments. Heroes, in the meantime are controlled individually and may join the tide of battle or choose to explore points of interest in search of numerous resources. Meanwhile, the event deck regularly changes the terms of the fight, making every wave exciting and unpredictable.</p>\r\n<p>As armies and minions approach opposing bases, they'll need to contend with Spires - powerful defense towers that can be built around the board. Fight for control of build sites and acquire new spire schematics to build an impenetrable defense and hold off the enemy. Upgrade your home base to unlock new strategies and abilities. Level up your heroes and lead your armies into battle with advanced and upgraded skills!</p>",

How would an Illusionist battle a Druid? Or a Warlock fight a Beastmaster? Or a Priestess fare against a Wizard?</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Mage Wars</strong></em> — redubbed <em>Mage Wars Arena</em> in 2015 to distinguish it from <em>Mage Wars Academy</em> — pits powerful Mages against each other in deadly arena combat. Each Mage uses his own fully-customizable book of spells to achieve total victory over his opponent. Summon mighty creatures to do battle in your name; cast powerful spells to attack your foe and thwart his every plan and strategy; use hidden enchantments to turn the tables and rule the day; adorn yourself with mighty weapons, armor, and arcane artifacts – all of this and more await you in the arena of <em>Mage Wars</em>!</p>\r\n<p><em>Mage Wars</em> is a tactical board game, a combination of a card game and miniatures game, combining the best elements from each genre. The game is played on an arena game board divided into square areas called &quot;zones&quot;, which regulate movement and the placement of objects. Each Mage (player) starts in a corner of the arena, opposite his enemy.</p>\r\n<p>Each player holds a spellbook, from which spell cards are pulled out as they are cast during the game. This has the feel of being a real Mage, turning the pages of your tome of magic, as you plan your strategy each turn. A point system allows you to choose spells for your spellbook, with more powerful spells and spells outside your schools of training costing more points. You have full access to cast any spell you want each turn, allowing for an unprecedented level of rich strategy and tactics. Many of these spells – such as creatures, equipment, and enchantments – are placed on the board and become objects in the game. Creatures can move around the arena, and attack each other and the enemy Mage. Attacks deal damage, as well as interesting special effects such as Burn, Corrode, Stun, Daze, Push, Cripple, Paralyze, etc. Creatures can be destroyed when they receive too much damage, or can be controlled by powerful curses and enchantments, or contained by walls and other creatures.</p>\r\n<p>Every Mage comes from a different school of magic, each with unique spells and strategies:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Beastmaster will try to rush and swarm the enemy with his hordes of animals, buffed by his nature enchantments.</li>\r\n<li>The Warlock will go right for the throat, armed with his powerful Lash of Hellfire, Helm of Fear, and Demonhide Armor. Along the way to the enemy Mage, he'll use his curses and fire attacks to contain and destroy enemy creatures.</li>\r\n<li>The Wizard is a trickster, a master of meta-magic: countering, stealing, redirecting, and destroying enemy spells and mana. He's also a master of teleportation and portals/gates.</li>\r\n<li>The Priestess will defend with knights and angels and powerful healing and protection spells. She'll wear down the enemy, then overwhelm them in the end.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The base game comes with all you need to get started: spellbooks, extra spells to customize with the spellbooks, arena game board, dice, markers, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Mage Wars Arena Contents:</p>\r\n<p>-2 New Spellbook designs<br /><br />-New Arena Board design<br /><br />-Alternate Art for Bear Strength, Dispel, Dissolve, Minor Heal and Rhino Hide<br /><br />-New Artwork for Battle Fury, Force Push, Hand of Bim Shalla, Teleport, and Temple of Light<br /><br />-Plus, 14 additional spell cards have been added to make spellbook building easier, including Dispel, Dissolve, Force Push and others</p>",

Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success.

Death, in all its many forms.</p>\r\n<p>Each player starts the game with a couple of humans, who each have a skill and a number of life points. On a turn, each player chooses to go to one location — possibly of the same type as other players, although not the same location — and while you have some idea of what you might find there, you won't know for sure until you arrive, at which point you might acquire food or resources, or find what you need to craft a useful object, or discover that you can aide someone else in their project, or suffer a snakebite that brings you close to death. Life is full of both wonders and terrors...</p>\r\n<p>At the day's end, you need food for all the people in your party as well as various crafts or skills that allow you to complete quests. Failure to do so adds another skull on the tote board, and once you collect enough of those, you decide that living is for fools and give up the ghost, declaring that future humans can just admire someone else, for all you care.</p>\r\n<p><em>Paleo</em> includes multiple modules that allow for a variety of people, locations, quests, and much more during your time in 10,000 BCE.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

The game is very easy to learn, featuring intuitive dice mechanics and thematic skills and abilities.

With the base game plus the expansion, (or two copies of either), a group can bring a party of four into the dungeon).

Each house is competing for Influence to gain the favor of Rome. Through a combination of political schemes and glorious battles on the arena sands your house will rise in fame and stature. As Dominus, you have a variety of resources at your disposal. Guards protect you from schemes launched by rivals. Slaves run your household and earn gold.

Schemes and Reactions are represented by cards in the Intrigue Deck. Players wield their Influence to put their Schemes into play, often asking for (or bribing) another player’s help in hatching the most complex plots.</p>\r\n<p>The Market Phase is when players buy, sell and trade Assets (Gladiators, Slaves, Equipment and Guards). Players also bid against each other to acquire new Assets at Auction. Wealth is not the only path to success as players bluff and bargain with each other to acquire the Assets they covet.</p>\r\n<p>The Arena Phase is when the bloody games are held. Gladiators from two rival Houses are pitted against each other in a brutal fight for glory. The spectacles of the games are represented by miniature combat on the arena board. Fighters pit their Attack, Defense and Speed dice against one another to determine the victor. All players seek to increase their fortunes by betting on the outcome of the gruesome conflict. Fighters who emerge from the arena victorious gain Favor and their Dominus gain Influence.</p>\r\n<p>The goal of the game is to become the most influential house in Capua, securing your family’s power for years to come. During the game, players will bribe, poison, betray, steal, blackmail, and undermine each other. Gold will change hands again and again to buy support, stay someone’s hand or influence their decisions. Will you be the honorable player whose word is their bond or the treacherous schemer whose alliances change with the wind?</p>",

However, their expensive wages make machines very desirable. To increase a factory's production of goods, you may hire more workers or improve the technological level of your factory.<br /><br />You determine the price of your goods for each of your factories.

Each turn goes as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Action Phase: Perform three actions, such as play new cards, get new cards from the market, speculate on cards in the market, buy land, or redeploy troops.<br />\r\n2. Discard Headlines: Remove any Headlines (i.e. cards with the Bull-Bear icon) that have reached the leftmost position in the Market.<br />\r\n3. Restore Market: Restore the Market to twelve cards.<br />\r\n4. Income Phase: Collect one gold per Income, Extortion, and Connection Cube in play. If Depression, pay one gold for each card in play (includes Partners and Enterprises in your Row, and all of your Troops).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four &quot;scoring&quot; cards (Toppling) are in the game and their effect depends on the current form of government. The government can change if troops are played and as a result of other cards. The form of government also influences different production values of the game, such as how much mines produce. Players win by toppling Díaz, either by coup, succession, revolution, or annexation of Mexico by the U.S. If Díaz remains firmly seated at the end of the game, then the player with the most gold wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pax Porfiriana</em> includes 220 cards, but only fifty cards (along with ten for each player) are used in a game, so no two games will be the same!</p><p>The Collector's Edition comes in a much bigger box, with additional pieces, mapboard, rules, and player aids.<br /></p>",

These all get placed on players' film-strips, to complete the movie production. So one movie might need 2 actors, but no music or effects and so on. As films are completed, the points value is marked and another film-strip taken. There are two parties each round where players get to pick from offers without paying anything. There are bonus points for first films completed and best films, best directors, even worst film.</p>\r\n<p>The auction is a basic rising offer with passing until one winning bid remains. Players pay into the pot with contracts as money, and the rest of the players share the pot each turn. So it's a closed economy with players trying to time to bid on what they really need to complete films.</p>",

Foremost of these great achievements in the city is the massive Porta Nigra, a large Roman city gate located in Trier, Germany that dates to the 2nd century.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game Porta Nigra (which translates as &quot;black gate&quot;) is set in that place and time with the players taking on the roles of Roman architects working on the city gate of Porta Nigra. Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located. Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully. The number and type of actions that may be performed on your turn comes from cards in your personal draw deck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe buildings in Porta Nigra are erected physically on the game board at the various locations in the city.  This is accomplished with 3-D plastic building pieces, which gives Porta Nigra a beautiful and compelling look on the table.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPorta Nigra is in the new Stronghold Games' The Great Designers Series - #1, which will be an ongoing series of games featuring the greatest game designers from around the world.

And you shouldn't be too greedy, if a sanctuary is not connected to more offerings than your previous sanctuary, you lose points!</p>",

If the round's customer buys your product, you win!<br /><br />To set up Snake Oil, each player takes six purple word cards. The customer for the round draws a customer card and announces it. Inventors quickly combine two purple word cards from their hand to form a crazy new product to sell to that customer. When ready, each inventor quickly pitches his or her product directly to the customer. The customer can end any pitch that goes longer than thirty seconds. The customer decides which product to buy and gives the inventor of that product the round's customer card as the prize. Inventors discard all used word cards and take two new word cards each. The player to the left of the customer becomes the next round's customer. Play repeats until each player has been the customer once.<br /><br />Whoever collects the most customer cards wins.</p>",

		"description": "<p><strong>Detective: City of Angels</strong>, set in the dark and violent world of 1940s Los Angeles, is a game of mystery, deception, and investigation for 1–5 players. Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to successfully close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies.</p>\r\n<p><em>Detective: CoA</em> uses the innovative ARC (Adaptive Response Card) System to create the feel of interrogating a suspect. Suspects do not simply give paragraph-book responses; instead The Chisel carefully chooses how they will answer. When Billy O'Shea insists that the victim was a regular at Topsy's Nightclub, is he telling the truth or is The Chisel subtly leading the detectives toward a dead end that will cost them precious time? Detectives can challenge responses that they think are lies but at great risk: If they're wrong, The Chisel will acquire leverage over them, making the case that much harder to solve.</p>\r\n<p><em>Detective: CoA</em> includes separate, detailed casebooks for both the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a carefully constructed puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways depending on how the detectives choose to pursue their investigations. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and &quot;hot&quot; leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience.</p>\r\n<p>Inspired by classic film noir like <em>The Big Sleep</em>, the works of James Ellroy (<em>L.A. Confidential</em>), and the video game <em>L.A. Noire</em> from Rockstar Games, <em>Detective: City of Angels</em> is a murder-mystery game unlike any other. Will one detective rise above the rest and close the case on L.A.'s latest high profile murder? Or will The Chisel sow enough doubt and confusion to prevent the detectives from solving the crime?</p>",

There are three eras - rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 - with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:<br /><br />* Buy new cards from the common display<br />* Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)<br />* Train/Educate your people<br />* Build/found cities<br />* Take money</p>",

Well get ready to be taught a lesson... in the nicest way possible!<br /><br /><strong>Pretty Pretty Smash Up</strong> brings the sweetest factions ever to the vicious fight for victory! Kitty Cats use their incredible cuteness to take control of enemy minions. Princesses ply their royalty, beauty and even their love to get their way. Fairies' fickle tricks give you options like never before, while the herds of Mythic Horses work together for dominance. Get ready: your opponents will never know what hit them!<br /><br />Fairies - From deep in the magical glades come these little sprites, bringing magical wishes and pixie dust (but only in emergencies) to your plans for world domination. Don't judge them by their size. The Fairies' magic gives you great options in how to deal with your enemies.<br /><br />Mythic Horses - The power of togetherness shows through in Horses, whose mighty herds race across the land, trampling any who stand in their way. Not only normal horses, but pegasi, sea-horses and more will join the fight for the base! Remember that friendship is... smashable!<br /><br />Kitty Cats - Can haz base? Kitty Cats have the power to compel those of weak will to do what they wish... and the power to have billions of internet memes. Perhaps those are the key? Either way, the Kitty Cats will use their alluring power to dominate the fight at any base. Then head out for a night of jazzy music in the alleys!<br /><br />Princesses - Dream a dream of ruling over your enemies! Princesses will make every wish come true through the power of pure love and happiness. Which can be used, oddly, to order everyone about, and even destroy your enemies. Don't be fooled: these innocent-looking beauties are few in number, but royal, strong and determined!<br /><br />Combine these groups into teams of two for various effects!
